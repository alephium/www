### Naming can be fun, but good naming is hard. Alephium has identified three items that desperately need naming, and we‚Äôd like to ask you for your creative input. How should we name the following items?

#### **The smallest denomination of¬†ALPH**

Bitcoin has the Satoshi (1 Satoshi = 0,0000001 BTC), Ethereum has the wei (1 wei = 0,000000000000000001 ETH, or 1 ETH = 1'000'000'000'000'000'000 wei).

**Similarly to ETH, ALPH‚Äôs smallest denomination also has 18 decimals (so 0,000000000000000001 ALPH) and we need a name for it!**

#### **Alephium‚Äôs custom Virtual¬†Machine**

A VM (or Virtual Machine) is what makes a blockchain more ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù and ‚Äúprogrammable‚Äù than just a transaction mechanism. It‚Äôs where the smart contracts live. Ethereum has the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). **What is Alephium‚Äôs custom Virtual Machine going to be called?**

#### **Alephium‚Äôs smart contract programming language.**

A smart contract programming language allows developers to create cool programs on a specific blockchain (like dApps for NFTs, DeFi or other use cases). ETH has Solidity, others have Pact, YUL or Rust‚Ä¶ **Help us find ours!**

### To participate and get a chance to win ALPH rewards, share your name proposals in the \#üí°suggestions channel on our Discord by following this link: <a href="https://discord.gg/s82ZXRw4Dc." class="markup--anchor markup--h3-anchor" data-href="https://discord.gg/s82ZXRw4Dc." rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/s82ZXRw4Dc.</a>

**The naming competition starts on January 31st, 2022 at 3:00pm CET and ends on February 2nd, 2022 at 18:00 CET.**

Involving the community is a good way to pool great resources of imagination and come up with the best, most accurate names for things. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/world/europe/boaty-mcboatface-what-you-get-when-you-let-the-internet-decide.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/world/europe/boaty-mcboatface-what-you-get-when-you-let-the-internet-decide.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">But it can also be tricky as many naming contests have ended up with all sorts of crazy user-suggested names.</a>

We are curious to see what our community can come up with while retaining some agency on our brand, so we invite you to propose the names of your choice and let the Alephium team vote for its favorite names in several categories.

Unleash your inner poet and make us dream, laugh and cry!

For each item to be named, the Alephium team will select and reward:

- <span id="f46d">Team‚Äôs favourite</span>
- <span id="cd05">The funniest name</span>
- <span id="e4b8">The ‚Äúnaming competition gone wrong‚Äù name</span>

_(We reserve the right to create new categories on the fly, remove them or change them based on the submissions during the course of the competition)_

**Winners will be announced on February 4th, 2022. If several persons have given the same name, the person who proposed the name first is the one that will be rewarded!**
