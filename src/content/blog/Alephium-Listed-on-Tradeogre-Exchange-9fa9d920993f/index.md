### Alephium Listed on Tradeogre Exchange

#### A Collective Effort by the Community

Alephium, the first operational sharded L1 blockchain scaling and enhancing PoW & UTXO concepts, has been listed on its second exchange: <a href="https://tradeogre.com/exchange/BTC-ALPH" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://tradeogre.com/exchange/BTC-ALPH" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tradeogre.com</a>! This is a significant milestone for Alephium, made possible due to its community push to get Alephium’s native token ALPH listed on a new exchange.

### “Wen new listing”

The Alephium community decided to reach out to TradeOgre and, working together, successfully got Alephium listed, and it can now be traded with the ALPH/BTC pair. This exciting development will undoubtedly make Alephium more accessible to a larger group of people and improve the token's liquidity.

Tradeogre is a cryptocurrency exchange that prides itself on being open to everyone, regardless of location. With minimal withdrawal fees and a 0.2% trading fee on all fulfilled orders, Tradeogre is committed to making cryptocurrency trading accessible to all.

The listing on Tradeogre is a big step towards greater circulation of ALPH, as it will expand the token’s reach to a wider geographical audience. Miners, hodlers, and traders who couldn’t trade ALPH on Gate.io due to geo-located restrictions will be particularly pleased to find out that they can now easily access and trade ALPH.
