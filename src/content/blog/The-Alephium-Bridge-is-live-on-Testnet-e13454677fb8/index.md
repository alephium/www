<figcaption>This is the hitchiker’s guide to Alephium’s first testnet bridge!</figcaption>
</figure>

A key to the future of Alephium is the ability to move tokens cross-chain, and since before the Leman Upgrade was ready, a lot of work has gone on working on the first bridge to another chain.

Today is a big step in that direction: **The Alephium Bridge is live on Testnet**.

This means transferring test tokens from Alephium’s testnet to Ethereum’s and BSC's testnet and back is possible!

You can interact with the testnet bridge using the following addresses:

Connect to the bridge via the portal URL: <a href="https://testnet.bridge.alephium.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://testnet.bridge.alephium.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://testnet.bridge.alephium.org/</a>

Bridge explorer: <a href="https://explorer.wormhole-testnet.alephium.org/explorer/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://explorer.wormhole-testnet.alephium.org/explorer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://explorer.wormhole-testnet.alephium.org/explorer/</a>

In this article, you will find all you need to successfully bridge two ways from Alephium testnet to Ethereum’s Goerli and BSC’s Testnet!

This includes the following steps:

> What do you need to know beforehand to connect to the bridge?

> How to connect to the Bridge?

> How to connect to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet?

> How to bridge an asset from Alephium to Goerli?

> How to bridge an asset from Goerli to Alephium?

Let’s get started!

### 1 — What you need to know before connecting to the bridge

<figure id="95fa" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3">
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZObINXgYH-n36EiZxE4aGQ.png" class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ZObINXgYH-n36EiZxE4aGQ.png" data-width="2878" data-height="1190" />
<figcaption>Get ready for a transformative experience</figcaption>
</figure>

_🚨 It is not yet possible to use the bridge on the mainnet   
🚨 Before starting, make sure you are connected to Alephium’s testnet!  
🚨 You need an address in Group 0 (on Alephium testnet). And test \$ALPH tokens_

**How to create an address in Group 0?**

- <span id="03e4">Open the Browser Extension Wallet:</span>
- <span id="95f2">Click on the current address name, and then in the “+” icon.</span>

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nSSqTlly8GQn-ZUhop9QtA.png)

- <span id="eafa">Click on the Group selector and choose Group 0. Now you have a new address in Group 0!</span>

**How to request test \$ALPH tokens?**

Don’t have \$ALPH in your wallet?

You can ask for some right from the wallet!

- <span id="5d0b">Click “Add funds” on the main page and then “Request \$ALPH.” You will receive 12 Testnet \$ALPH in a few minutes.</span>

### 2 — How to connect to the bridge?

<figure id="c047" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3">
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JvEpK8zI9Ocpr27_IktV4g.png" class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*JvEpK8zI9Ocpr27_IktV4g.png" data-width="2880" data-height="1186" />
<figcaption>Hop on the wagon and let’s go!</figcaption>
</figure>

To connect to the bridge, go to <a href="https://portal-bridge.wormhole-testnet.alephium.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://portal-bridge.wormhole-testnet.alephium.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://portal-bridge.wormhole-testnet.alephium.org</a>

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*syU58JpvRvUQzhDj-3nLGA.png)

Once on the page, click on the “connect” button. A prompt will appear, and you can choose which wallet you want to use to connect to the bridge.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*60xd9WA1ov8U95moCsxWGw.png)

You can use the <a href="https://medium.com/@alephium/alephium-launches-browser-extension-wallet-706dfeda98f5" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@alephium/alephium-launches-browser-extension-wallet-706dfeda98f5" target="_blank">Extension Wallet</a> or the <a href="https://medium.com/@alephium/the-desktop-wallet-2-0-d818bc1c722b" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@alephium/the-desktop-wallet-2-0-d818bc1c722b" target="_blank">Desktop Wallet</a>. (the WalletConnect option is currently not supported).

After choosing your connection method, you can see your address below the two chains form.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fAlLkkUuex_lRv-YshUhAQ.png)

The token bridge helps to send a token from one network to another. Now that you’re connected on Alephium’s side, it is time to connect to the other side: The first destination, the Goerli Ethereum testnet.

### 3 — How to connect to the Goerli Ethereum testnet?

<figure id="2747" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3">
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZCbruOp6T_n49kcJMCzWIQ.png" class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ZCbruOp6T_n49kcJMCzWIQ.png" data-width="2870" data-height="1182" />
<figcaption>Goerli workers fixing transactions</figcaption>
</figure>

To connect to the Goerli Ethereum testnet, you will need a wallet. In this example, we’ll use <a href="https://metamask.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://metamask.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Metamask</a> but it would work similarly with other wallets.

🚨 _If using Metamask, before starting the process, go to the “advanced settings”, and make sure that the “show test networks” toggle is activated!_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*D5Xi0EyZryFKG0uhHsAwVA.png)

If you’re on a different chain, you must change to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TuzycCK8fpFYyIdnuH2hTA.png)

Click the “Ethereum Mainnet” button and select the “Goerli Testnet” as the network.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sYrxLLn1ayYRuf4a8n_Iag.png)

You will see that the network name has changed to “Goerli test network.”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Z39YTaNSxl_mIhEZdc81Ug.png)

You will need enough GoerliETH to pay the fast fee for your incoming transaction on the Goerli Testnet (and send it to the Alephium Testnet).

You can get 0.2 GoerliETH/day (It requires a subscription) here: <a href="https://goerlifaucet.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://goerlifaucet.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://goerlifaucet.com/</a>

<a href="https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/goerli" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/goerli" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/goerli</a> is another option (no subscription), but not as reliable and fast as the previous one. It provides 0.005 GoerliETH/day.

After receiving the ETH Goerli tokens, your Metamask wallet will be able to pay the transaction fee for the bridge of the target chain.

**How to add ETH to your Browser Extension Wallet**

If you bridged BNB to Alephium, you must add the token information to your wallet. To do that, click on “New Token.”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xxPMqtYvsjgpbQslh5NwAg.png)

Now you have a new page to add the information about the token.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-c-xhaEf6tAqkBrYXBPfLQ.png)

Fill all the fields with the following:

> Token Id: 4db93c3e58ca4c3392b9d47be17b62fcbabccba61a7d7c1fa1c3baa40181f700;

> Name: BNB (Portal)

> Symbol: WBNB

> Decimals: 18

> Logo URI: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alephium/tokens-meta/master/logos/WBNB.png" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" data-href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alephium/tokens-meta/master/logos/WBNB.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alephium/tokens-meta/master/logos/WBNB.png</a>

The token is now showing in your wallet.

**Using the “Redeem” section of the bridge**.

If, for some reason, you left the bridge page before redeeming your tokens, you can always get your transaction hash from <a href="https://explorer.testnet.alephium.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://explorer.testnet.alephium.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://explorer.testnet.alephium.org/</a>, and then click “Redeem” on the bridge page, paste it into the “source TX” field, and click “Recover.”
