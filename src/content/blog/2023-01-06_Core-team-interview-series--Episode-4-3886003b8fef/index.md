_For its team, Alephium is privileging agility and efficiency over hyper-growth. The project does stay at a human size not because it is more efficient, but because Alephium strives to be a decentralized, community-driven project. This means the project in itself is much larger than a team can ever be. Communication, trust, openness, and transparency are paramount in such a setup._

_To shed some light on who we are and what we do, we decided to share a little about ourselves with the community through a small series of interviews.

### 5â€Šâ€”â€ŠHow/when did you come acrossÂ crypto?

Like many people, I learned about crypto in 2017 when a broker tried to sell me some Bitcoins.
