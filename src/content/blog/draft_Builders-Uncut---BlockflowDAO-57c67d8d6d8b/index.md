_This interview was conducted around the Athens Builders Meetup, which took place at the end of June 2024. If you’re just discovering Alephium’s ecosystem, it’s a great way to learn about all the main projects!_

#### Could you briefly introduce yourself, and tell us about your life in crypto and how you came to Alephium?

Ryan: My name’s <a href="https://x.com/ryan_alph" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://x.com/ryan_alph" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ryan</a>. I’m a mechanical engineer from America. I found crypto around 2019 through Ethereum mining. When Ethereum started moving towards proof of stake, I discovered Alephium through a random YouTube video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwBtEu5JRlk" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwBtEu5JRlk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Is Alephium the next Ethereum?”</a> I got interested in mining it, joined <a href="http://alephium.org/discord" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="http://alephium.org/discord" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discord</a>, took a break during the bear market, and came back to see Alephium still building. That’s when I got hooked.

**Diomark:** I’m Mark, also known as <a href="https://x.com/diomark" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://x.com/diomark" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Diomark</a> on various platforms. I accidentally got into mining — I jokingly posted on Facebook about running gaming benchmarks to warm up my cold basement, and a friend suggested mining. I started mining Ethereum right before its big surge, and then I discovered Alephium when their mainnet went live. I switched to Alephium, got heavily involved with the community, and have stuck around since.

CGI: I go by <a href="https://x.com/cg1_bin" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://x.com/cg1_bin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CGI-bin</a> online. I discovered Alephium through a colleague, joined Discord, mined the testnet, and waited for the mainnet launch. I’ve been building and testing new things since then, meeting great people in the community like Ryan, Diomark, and others. I’m mostly interested in Bitcoin, but Alephium is one of the first coins I’ve really held onto.

#### Can you tell us about the BlockFlow DAO and why it was created?

**CGI:** The Alephium team contacted us to ask if we wanted to help raise awareness about Alephium. The idea was to engage the community, bring new ideas, and encourage projects to join and grow the ecosystem.

**Diomark:** We knew Alephium was good, but felt like no one else knew. So, we got involved to spread awareness, bring new projects to ALPH, and let people know about us, both on the marketing and ecosystem development sides.

**Ryan:** I was just an active community member, and this is the first project I’ve been deeply involved in. When the team contacted me, I was already passionate about educating the crypto community on Alephium, so I was eager to help.

#### What are the achievements you’re most proud of, and what do you want to do more of?

**Ryan:** We’ve had several successes, like the fundraiser for MEXC, which was a big win for Alephium. I’m also proud of the <a href="https://alephiumgazette.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://alephiumgazette.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alephium Gazette</a> and the different <a href="https://x.com/alephium/status/1818326917881196594" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://x.com/alephium/status/1818326917881196594" rel="noopener" target="_blank">language communities</a> that have been built. These initiatives are invaluable for spreading awareness.

Diomark: We’ve worked with some exchanges and are continuing to look into new opportunities. The next step is to bring in more projects, pulling successful ones from other ecosystems and encouraging them to move over to Alephium.

#### What do you think is lacking in the ecosystem, and what should be prioritized?

**Ryan:** The Athens meetup has been eye-opening. Many great projects are coming to Alephium, like Swapa and AlphBanX, which are stablecoin and lending protocols. More DEXs and a real-world use case would be amazing for Alephium.

**Diomark:** We need to research what’s working on other chains and what apps are drawing people in. We should focus on bringing those to Alephium.

**CGI:** It’s not that anything is lacking — it’s just not here yet. Once developers understand the Alephium experience, they’ll come. We just need to keep researching and attracting the right projects.

#### What’s next for the DAO?

**Ryan:** We’re working on engaging the community more in decision-making. We’re also focusing on researching other top chains, identifying high TVL projects, and finding teams to build similar projects on Alephium. Decentralizing decision-making within the DAO is a medium to long-term goal.

**CGI:** We’re moving towards more community involvement in proposals and decision-making. We’ll be announcing more about this soon to give a clearer vision of the DAO’s future direction.
