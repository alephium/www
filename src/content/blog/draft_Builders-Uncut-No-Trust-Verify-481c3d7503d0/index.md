#### Who are you, and what do you do?

We are a team called No Trust Verify (NTV), focused on experimentation, self-sovereignty, and privacy. We’re a group of four, but we prefer to stay discreet and under the radar. Our work revolves around creating dApps and tools for blockchain, particularly on Alephium.

#### How long have you been working as No Trust Verify?

We’ve been around for over two years. We started with two projects, including Alephium, and decided to dive deep into its technology. We’re still here, building and contributing to the ecosystem.

#### How did you get into crypto?

I got into crypto out of interest in peer-to-peer systems and the possibility of exchanging money over the internet. This curiosity led me to explore Bitcoin and its technology, which sparked my deeper interest in the tech behind it.

#### How did you discover Alephium?

A colleague mentioned Alephium to me while it was still in the testnet phase. I joined Discord, started mining on the testnet, and after connecting with the Alephium team, we decided to begin our journey with Alephium.

#### What have you built on Alephium?

We’ve built various tools, such as the <a href="https://x.com/AlphWhale" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://x.com/AlphWhale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alephium Whales Watcher</a>, <a href="https://www.alephium.world/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.alephium.world/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alephium World</a>, and a bot for mining notifications. During a hackathon, we also developed the <a href="https://t.me/TipAlphBot" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://t.me/TipAlphBot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TipAlph</a> bot, which allows users to tip others seamlessly through Telegram.

#### How has your experience with Alephium evolved?

Alephium has grown rapidly, and the team listens closely to community feedback, implementing changes and improvements. The recent developer meetup was a great opportunity to connect face-to-face with people we’ve been chatting with online for years.

#### What’s it like running a guardian for the Alephium bridge?

<a href="https://medium.com/@alephium/the-alephium-bridge-a787d90b2e4a" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@alephium/the-alephium-bridge-a787d90b2e4a" target="_blank">Running a guardian</a> has been a valuable learning experience. We’ve gained insight into how the Wormhole fork works and how the bridge operates. We’re ready to expand to other chains if they become available.

#### What’s next for No Trust Verify?

We plan to continue building tools, helping projects launch, and exploring new dApps. We’re excited about the upcoming projects on Alephium and look forward to diving deeper into them.

#### How do you feel about the Alephium community?

The Alephium community is fantastic — very strong and supportive. It’s great to see everyone helping each other and being enthusiastic about new projects. We enjoy being a part of this community and contributing to its growth.

#### What advice do you have for newcomers to the Alephium community?
