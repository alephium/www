### Builders Uncut — Intrepid

![](image_5828c9fc16.png)

_This interview was conducted around the Athens Builders Meetup, which took place at the end of June 2024. If you’re just discovering Alephium’s ecosystem, it’s a great way to learn about all the main projects!_

Here, <a href="https://x.com/intrepid_crypto" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://x.com/intrepid_crypto" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intrepid</a> (Tony), shares his journey and experiences in the tech industry, specifically in software development and blockchain technology, and how he discovered Alephium. Find the full (slightly edited) transcript below if you prefer reading.

#### Can you tell us first, who are you?

Yeah, for sure! My name is Tony, I’m from Toronto, Canada. I’m currently a software developer. By way of background, I got involved in Alephium mining back in the day. I joined the Discord community, found it super active, and felt it was a community with which I could grow.

#### What kind of software engineer are you?

I’m a web developer. Blockchain was something a lot of people were teaching, so I started developing different prototypes. It was really fun to build on.

#### And what’s your journey in crypto? Where did it start?

I started as a miner. I found the process of putting hardware together and using GPUs to mine coins fascinating. That journey led me to read more and learn about cryptography and the underlying principles of different blockchains. I found Elysium special because it tackled blockchain problems while also aiming for real-world applications.

So that’s how I got into crypto. I think it has a lot of room for disruption. Besides software development, I have a background in finance. I started investing in infrastructure and worked for Shopify on their payment side. I see how crypto can disrupt traditional industries. That’s why I’m looking to build apps on blockchain and continue learning. It’s an industry that I think will continue to innovate and grow.

#### We met you online during the hackathon. You built the beginning of a lending protocol prototype, right? I remember your background in finance and your new life in tech. Can you tell us how that evolved over the past six months since the hackathon?

Yeah, I’m a big DeFi user. I’ve started using lending and borrowing platforms such as Aave and Uniswap. These platforms allow you to borrow against collateral, and the transactions are instantaneous. I see the power of DeFi to disrupt existing industries, eliminate middlemen, and facilitate cross-border payments. That’s why I tried to build a prototype during the hackathon.

There’s huge potential for DeFi, whether it’s a lending and borrowing protocol or advancements in automated market makers. These innovations can change how people handle finance and commerce.

#### Did you get a chance to discuss this with Alphbanx in Athens? He’s building a lending protocol on top of Alephium.

Unfortunately, I didn’t. There were a lot of people at the builders’ meetup, so I didn’t get a chance to speak to him in person.

#### But you saw the presentation, so you got a sense of what’s being built. Are you still working on the lending protocol, or are you focusing on other projects?

I’m exploring how to build real-world commerce applications with crypto. I recently attended a Shopify conference called <a href="https://www.editions.dev/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.editions.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Editions.dev</a>, where they taught us how to build checkout and customer account extensions. I see opportunities to link with Alephium, such as using NFTs for loyalty, storing web pixel data on-chain, or even creating receipts. Many tech companies like Shopify, Visa, and JPMorgan are exploring blockchain. Integrating blockchain into these platforms can increase adoption.

#### That’s really interesting. Can you tell us about your thoughts on the meetup, the other builders, and the general energy of the ecosystem?

I loved it. It was very friendly, with many developers. I got to speak to creators like <a href="https://alephium-battle.vercel.app/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://alephium-battle.vercel.app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alephium Battle</a> and <a href="https://theducklounge.com/#/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://theducklounge.com/#/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">What The Duck</a>. Their approach was driven by curiosity and enthusiasm for blockchain. They were happy to see the rewards of their work.

Talking to them gave me a lot of ideas. The atmosphere was great for mingling and exploring different ideas, whether about AMMs or other projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/jhzjXJjMDSk" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://youtu.be/jhzjXJjMDSk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phoenix Finance's presentation</a> was particularly good. It reminded me of the <a href="https://medium.com/@alephium/second-developer-workshop-re-implementing-friend-techs-smart-contract-in-ralph-806e3f6551aa" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@alephium/second-developer-workshop-re-implementing-friend-techs-smart-contract-in-ralph-806e3f6551aa" target="_blank">Friend Tech tutorial</a> that Alephium has on YouTube. Simple formulas can dictate business models and incentivize people to hold long-term.

Meeting the core team was great, too. Hong Chao, Cheng, yourself, Maud, and others were there. The thoughts around UX were really cool. The DAO was present, and the ideas about decentralization reiterated the core team’s beliefs. It was about building a developer community and a collective effort towards something greater.

#### Of all the projects you’ve seen or talked about, which one are you most excited about?

I think there’s a lot of potential for the ecosystem to grow together. DeFi protocols can provide additional liquidity. The naming system will be beneficial, and the upcoming Oracle can help with DeFi apps. The <a href="https://x.com/0x_reed" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://x.com/0x_reed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">creator</a> of <a href="https://theducklounge.com/#/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://theducklounge.com/#/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">What The Duck</a> is continually innovating with NFTs. He’s also building a tool that scans the landscape of Alephium and developing a gaming system for What The Duck. Leaf in Battle’s enthusiasm was evident; he even brought physical NFT cards to share.

There are many interesting projects. Collaboratively, they will grow the ecosystem as a whole. For example, <a href="https://alephium-battle.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://alephium-battle.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alephium Battle</a> guys travelled from Argentina to Athens, which shows his dedication. It was quite a trip from Toronto as well, so it was an honour to be part of the weekend event.

#### You’ve been in the ecosystem for six or seven months now. What’s your experience with the developer environment and the feedback loop with core contributors?

It’s amazing. The core team’s dedication and passion are unmatched. I’ve been in other communities, but the feedback loop here is exceptional. They’re interested in your projects and willing to review your repos and answer questions online.

This environment fosters growth and learning from others. Blockchain is continually evolving, and Alephium’s professionalism and commitment to building real-world applications are impressive. It’s not just about speculation; it’s about creating apps that can potentially disrupt traditional industries and gain mass adoption.

Cheng’s vision for scalability, Alephium's lightweight nature due to PoW, and the sharding approach are all forward-thinking. He’s committed to making the blockchain future-proof and accessible to consumer-grade hardware.
