We are thrilled to announce that Alephium’s highly anticipated Danube network upgrade will activate on **Tuesday, July 15, 2025, at 12:00 GMT+02:00**!

Danube is not just another upgrade. It is a leap forward for Web3 usability, scalability, and security. This milestone brings Alephium closer to the Web3 experience we were all promised: fast, accessible, and truly decentralized.

## What’s Coming with Danube?

Danube delivers new features that set Alephium apart:

* **8-Second Block Times & 2 Blocks Per Second (BPS) Network Throughput**

Alephium now produces blocks twice as fast, matching leading Proof of Stake chains. Confirmations feel instant, boosting dApp responsiveness and user experience.

* **Optimized Consensus & Syncing**

Alephium’s BlockFlow processes transactions more efficiently, enabling over 20,000 TPS and up to three times faster node sync. The result is greater scalability and decentralization with lower overhead.

* **Seamless Scalability with Groupless Addresses**

Scaling without complexity. Alephium’s Groupless Addresses unify balances and abstract shard logic, making sharding invisible to users. Danube delivers the most advanced and user-friendly sharding implementation to date.

* **Secure, Seedless Onboarding**

Native Passkey support enables login with Face ID, Touch ID, or YubiKey. Seed phrases are optional, lowering the barrier to entry and bringing Web2-grade ease to Web3.

* **Chained Transactions**

Transaction caller’s assets can now be reused across multiple contract calls within a single TxScript (e.g., A→B→C swaps). This improves composability for dApps, streamlining complex flows without sacrificing the security benefits of the UTXO model.

* **Enhanced Developer Experience**

Developers benefit from improved tooling, cleaner logic, and more expressive power: automatic handling of dust amounts, contract deposit and map entry deposit, I256 bitwise operations, and better mechanisms for caller identification simplify smart contract design.

Alephium combines the simplicity and security of Bitcoin, the programmability of Ethereum, and the speed of modern Layer 1s, all on a decentralized, energy efficient Proof of Work foundation.

The Danube upgrade builds on this foundation, bringing new features and improvements that make Alephium even more scalable, user friendly, and powerful.
