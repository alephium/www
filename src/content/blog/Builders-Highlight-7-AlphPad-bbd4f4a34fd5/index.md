This episode is about <a href="https://alphpad.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://alphpad.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AlphPad</a>, an Alephium-native launchpad for IDOs. Here they share a little bit about his inspiration, the challenges this project brought, and some plans for the future.

#### **Please tell us a bit about yourself. What is it you do? (as a job, as a hobby, or in general!)**

<a href="https://twitter.com/tinfoilhatc4t" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://twitter.com/tinfoilhatc4t" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tinfoil Cat</a>: We are a small and lean team that has been deeply involved in the crypto space for a long time. Weâ€™ve witnessed the inception of many trends like DeFi, NFTs, etc. Passionate about crypto, we both started as miners, transitioned to investing and on-chain ecosystems, and are now focusing on development.

#### Tell us a little bit about your project. What is it, what does it do, and how does it interact with the Alephium blockchain?

<a href="https://twitter.com/krk0d3r" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://twitter.com/krk0d3r" rel="noopener" target="_blank">krk0d3r</a>: Weâ€™re developing a <a href="https://twitter.com/alphpad" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://twitter.com/alphpad" rel="noopener" target="_blank">token launchpad</a> with a clear mission: to empower the next wave of innovative blockchain projects on Alephium. As strong believers in Alephiumâ€™s potential, we want to contribute to its burgeoning ecosystem.

#### How did you find out about Alephium? What motivated you to develop on the Alephium blockchain, and what sets it apart from other blockchain platforms?

Tinfoil Cat: Weâ€™ve been engaged with Alephium for over a year, focusing on mining and investing. Its unique features and growing community motivated us to develop on this blockchain, setting it apart from others.

#### What tech stack did you use in your project? What did you consider when choosing the right tech stack for yourÂ project?

krk0d3r: Our project utilizes proven technologies in the crypto space. Weâ€™ve built the frontends using React and Next.js, while the contracts are developed with Ralph. For optimal performance, we host our frontends on Cloudflare.

#### What features are you most proud/happy of?

Tinfoil Cat: Weâ€™re particularly proud of our unique reward distribution mechanism. Itâ€™s designed to circumvent common pitfalls in launchpads; as far as we know, itâ€™s the first of its kind.

#### Could you tell us about some of the challenges you faced while building and how you overcameÂ them?

krk0d3r: Weâ€™re in the midst of building and face challenges daily. We prefer to share specific experiences post-completion, taking it one step at a time.

#### What has been the most rewarding part of developing your project, andÂ why?

Krk0der: The most rewarding aspect has been learning new technologies and becoming part of an emerging ecosystem. Itâ€™s an exciting challenge that we look forward to every day.

#### How do you see the future of your project? Do you have aÂ roadmap?

krk0der: Our roadmap, which you can find on our website and in our documentation, lays out our direction for the upcoming year. While we have a strategic vision extending beyond four years, we reveal these longer-term plans incrementally as they transition into our immediate roadmap.

#### What advice would you give to someone looking to build on Alephium, based on your experience? In your opinion, how can the Alephium ecosystem foster a more vibrant developer Community?

Tinfoil Cat: Building on Alephium now is promising, given the limited competition and the new VM that challenges developers to innovate. We look forward to the evolution of Alphâ€™s VM and its documentation, making it more inviting for developers.

#### How do you engage with the Alephium community, and how has this community influenced your project development?

Tinfoil Cat: Presenting our project to the Alephium community was met with incredible support and engagement, exceeding our expectations. Their response has positively influenced our development.

#### Where can we stay in touch with your project & with you? Is it possible to contribute?

Tinfoil cat: You can follow us on major <a href="https://twitter.com/alphpad" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://twitter.com/alphpad" rel="noopener" target="_blank">social platforms</a>; find the links at the bottom of our website. Currently, weâ€™re focused on a small, dedicated team, but as the project evolves, more opportunities for community contribution will open up.

#### Anything else youâ€™d want toÂ add?

Tinfoil cat: Embarking on this journey with Alph at this moment is exhilarating. Itâ€™s a golden opportunity to be early in a rising ecosystem. We have ambitious plans for the future and hope the community will join us on this exciting journey.
