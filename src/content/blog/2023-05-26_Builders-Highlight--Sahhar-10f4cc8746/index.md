### Builders Highlight: Sahhar

#### _Alephiumâ€™s ecosystem thrives with developers building amazing stuff on top of Alephium (services, dApps, etcâ€¦) that deliver a unique experience and provide real utility for the users. In the Builders Highlight series, these builders will share more about their projects and also their thoughts and insights on why building on Alephium!_

The first builder in the series is **Sahhar**, the community developer behind the <a href="https://github.com/sahharYoucef/alephium_wallet" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://github.com/sahharYoucef/alephium_wallet" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sahhar Mobile Wallet</a> available on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sahhar.sahhar_wallet" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sahhar.sahhar_wallet" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google Play store</a>. It features advanced security options, like multisig management, but donâ€™t take our word for it, letâ€™s see what Sahhar has to say about his project:

#### Tell us a little bit about your project. What is it, what does it, and how does it interact with the Alephium blockchain?

It is a wallet for mobile, built using a cross-platform framework called Flutter so that it can work for iOs and Android.

#### What motivated you to develop on Alephium blockchain, and what set it apart from other blockchain platforms?

I joined the <a href="https://t.me/alephiumgroup" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://t.me/alephiumgroup" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alephium group chat</a> in its early days, and I noticed that there was a lot of work and development happening in the background, and <a href="https://github.com/alephium" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://github.com/alephium" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> was always on fire! Cheng also was followed by Kushti, founder of Ergo, who is one of the best blockchain developers, in my opinion, and was also a member of the Alephium group chat.

#### What tech stack did you use in your project? What did you consider when choosing the right tech stack for yourÂ project?

I used <a href="https://flutter.dev/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://flutter.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flutter/Dart,</a> which is a framework created by Google for building cross-platform apps. Itâ€™s really fast and gives native apps equivalent performance when compared to other frameworks like <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://reactnative.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">React Native</a>, and you can build on iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Web using a single codebase.

#### What features are you most proudÂ of?

The multisig wallet! Itâ€™s still using the <a href="https://docs.alephium.org/dapps/public-services/#node-and-explorer-apis" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://docs.alephium.org/dapps/public-services/#node-and-explorer-apis" rel="noopener" target="_blank">node API</a> to sign the transaction, but Iâ€™ll make the algorithm run locally soon.

#### Could you tell us about some of the challenges you faced while building and how you overcameÂ them?

The biggest challenge for me was the encryption-decryption, as some packages werenâ€™t available for Dart, so I had to copy them from Javascript to be able to use them.

#### What has been the most rewarding part of developing your project, andÂ why?

I donâ€™t feel there was any most rewarding part, my motivation was to keep developing the wallet and make it better.

#### What do you think are some of the future potential use cases of Alephium that could be explored?

DeFi is one of the strongest use cases for blockchain technology, and as Alephium is growing fast, I hope to see many projects and devs building on it!

#### Lastly, what advice would you give to someone looking to build on Alephium, based on your experience?

My advice is for devs to <a href="https://docs.alephium.org/dapps/build-dapp-from-scratch" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://docs.alephium.org/dapps/build-dapp-from-scratch" rel="noopener" target="_blank">find out how to build</a> on Alephium. There are a lot of good opportunities for building interesting stuff! Alephium is giving rewards for interesting and good projects, so they have a nice opportunity to mirror projects from other chains to Alephium while benefiting from Alephiumâ€™s unique chain features, like high speed and low transaction fees.

Thanks, Sahhar for your answers! Alephium is thrilled to have such talent builders in the community!
