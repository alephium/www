_This interview was conducted around the Athens Builders Meetup, which took place at the end of June 2024. If you’re just discovering Alephium’s ecosystem, it’s a great way to learn about all the main projects!_

Here, Wojciech dives into his work on Alephium, highlighting the unique scalability features that drew him to the platform. He’s leading the development of Invariant, a cutting-edge AMM focused on improving capital efficiency in DeFi. Find the full (slightly edited) transcript below if you prefer reading.

#### Can you introduce yourself and tell us about your journey into crypto?

I’m Wojciech, originally from Poland. My journey in crypto started back in 2017, but unlike many, I didn’t dive in through speculation. Instead, I began by learning the technical side of things. My first significant project was building my own blockchain from scratch. That experience fueled my passion for smart contracts and DeFi, where I’ve focused on solving challenges like capital inefficiency and mitigating risks such as impermanent loss.

#### What brought you to Alephium? How did you discover it?

While I was working on Solana, I was also exploring other layer-one blockchains that could scale efficiently and manage high transaction speeds. During this exploration, I stumbled upon Alephium. Its unique technology, particularly the stateful UTXO model and sharding, caught my attention. Before discovering Alephium, I didn’t think it was possible to build complex applications like concentrated liquidity on a proof-of-work blockchain. But Alephium proved me wrong — it was the only proof-of-work chain I found that could offer the scalability needed for a robust DeFi ecosystem.

#### Can you explain what Invariant is and what your team is working on?

I’m currently working on <a href="https://invariant.app/swap" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://invariant.app/swap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Invariant</a> with a team of developers. Our focus is on creating a Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker (CLAMM). The primary goal of Invariant is to address capital inefficiency in AMMs.

We’ve developed a modular and customizable solution that allows users to have full control over their positions. Whether you’re an advanced user or just looking for an easier way to manage your liquidity, Invariant is designed to cater to your needs. Our approach allows for a more efficient and user-friendly experience compared to traditional AMMs.

#### What has your experience been like developing on Alephium?

We started developing on Alephium during a hackathon, and at that time, the Ralph language lacked some basic features. However, the platform has made significant progress since then. With the <a href="https://medium.com/@alephium/rh%C3%B4ne-network-upgrade-activated-cbeb298585fe" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@alephium/rh%C3%B4ne-network-upgrade-activated-cbeb298585fe" target="_blank">Rhône network upgrade</a>, the development experience has improved dramatically. The shorter block times have created a better environment for building decentralized exchanges, which is essential for the growth of the DeFi ecosystem on Alephium.

#### How was your experience at the Alephium Builders Meetup?

I really enjoyed the Builders Meetup in Athens. It was a fantastic opportunity to connect with developers from different countries, including some from Poland, which was a pleasant surprise. The atmosphere was great, the lectures were insightful, and the event's overall vibe was positive. Meeting other developers in person was an invaluable experience, as we shared ideas and learned from each other.
