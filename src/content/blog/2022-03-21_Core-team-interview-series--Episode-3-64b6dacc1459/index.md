### Core team interview series. Episode 3

#### Presenting the humans developing the Back-end.

_For its team, Alephium is privileging agility and efficiency over hyper-growth. We do not stay at a human size because we think it is more efficient, but because Alephium strives to be a decentralized, community driven project. This means the project in itself is much larger than a team can ever be. Communication, trust, openness and transparency is paramount in such a set-up._

_To shed some light on who we are and what we do, we decided to share a little about ourselves with the community through a small series of interviews._

Read the <a href="https://medium.com/@alephium/core-team-interview-series-episode-1-3472f8295af6" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@alephium/core-team-interview-series-episode-1-3472f8295af6" target="_blank">1st part here</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/@alephium/core-team-interview-series-episode-2-bec6e6908d2f" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@alephium/core-team-interview-series-episode-2-bec6e6908d2f" target="_blank">2nd part here.</a>

The Back-end is the heart of the system, but it is also a less obvious part of the development to the average observer: the less a back-end gets noticed the better job it is doing.

**6 individuals are building the back-end and we are happy to introduce you to Thomas, muchen, h0ngcha0, Benoit, Simer and Cheng.**

### Thomas

</figure>

#### How should we call you and where are you located?

Simply Thomas, I’m located in the Lausanne area.

#### What/where did you study? What are your past notable experiences?

I studied computer science at EPFL, where I did a bachelor/master degree. Before cryptos I worked in the autonomous vehicles field.

#### Do you have funny, sporty, geeky or cranky hobbies?

I used to do traditional Swiss wrestling: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN3MCKCTtrg" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN3MCKCTtrg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN3MCKCTtrg</a>

Now I’m more into music: guitar/alphorn/singing.

#### How/when did you come across crypto?

I heard a lot about it, but really went into it when joining Alephium :)

> I already worked with Cheng and the rest of the team, I knew I would love to work with them again, so I dived more into the project.

#### How did you come across Alephium and what attracted you to the project?

I already worked with Cheng and the rest of the team, I knew I would love to work with them again, so I dived more into the project. I didn’t know much about crypto back then, but this all sharded-decentralized network technology looked awesome to build. I think I discovered a bit later the potential of Alephium compared to the other blockchains.

#### What are you doing at Alephium? What is your title (if you have one, what would it be, if you don’t)? What are you good at?

I’m a core developer, as I joined quite early the project I had the opportunity to work on almost every part of the project. Then I concentrated on all the surrounding of the blockchain itself: the node-wallet, the explorer-backend, all the APIs, everything that helps interacting with the blockchain itself.

#### What is it you care the most for in our creation?

I would say our team, even though it’s a small one, everyone is where they should be and we built great stuff thanks to that.

### Benoit

</figure>

#### How should we call you and where are you located?

My name is Benoit, killerwhile, or @0xa05e30471e8a on Discord. I’m mostly based in Switzerland.

#### What/where did you study? What are your past notable experiences?

I graduated from EPFL, Lausanne where I learnt software engineering, But what I love overall in computer science is infrastructure and plumbing. I was DevOps before the word DevOps became trendy.

#### Do you have funny, sporty, geeky or cranky hobbies?

I’ve been snowboarding for more than 20 years, teaching trampoline to my kids, and playing volleyball when I want to socialize.

#### Got links?

My socials are probably not interesting enough to be shared.

#### How/when did you come across crypto?

I learned about crypto back in 2010, and followed this trend from a technical perspective, running an ETH full node and nowadays ETH2.0 validators and Alephium full nodes.

> Simplicity and elegance of blockflow \[attracted me\] because I come from a distributed processing world, and I found in blockflow lots of echo from other components I admire and have contributed to in the past.

#### How did you come across Alephium and what attracted you to the project?

I know a guy who knew Cheng, and got introduced. Both the early stage and the simplicity of blockflow hooked me up with Alephium. Early stage because the whole ecosystem still needs to be built, and I love building things. Simplicity and elegance of blockflow because I come from a distributed processing world, and I found in blockflow lots of echo from other components I admire and have contributed to in the past.

#### What are you doing at Alephium? What is your title (if you have one, what would it be, if you don’t)? What are you good at?

At Alephium, I’m mostly in charge of the infrastructure, i.e. running a significant amount of full nodes to ensure the stability of the network. I don’t care much about titles, and Alephium’s infrastructure reliability speaks on my behalf.

But if I was forced to choose a title, I’d call myself Plumbing engineer. Or CFO, for Chief Fondue Officer. Because apart from building infrastructure, I’m amazingly proficient with cheese, being Fondue or Raclette.

#### What is it you care the most for in our creation?

Blockflow technology is so simple that many other projects are asking themselves why they didn’t think about it already. And bringing stability and resiliency to this awesome technology is what I care the most about this creation.
