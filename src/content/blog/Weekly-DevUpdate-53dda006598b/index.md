ðŸŽ‡ Multisig Toolkit got its final details; Mobile wallet development is going strong, and the UI/UX Twitter Space with Swissborg & <a href="https://www.lace.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.lace.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lace.io</a> was a blast!

### Backend TeamÂ Updates

#### Full Node Adjustments

The `useAssetsInContract` function signature has been removed from the Full Node for streamlining purposes, simplifying the function call processes for developers.

#### Software Development KitÂ (SDK)

Several important changes have been made to the SDK. A new interface called `INFTCollectionWithRoyalty` has been introduced to better handle royalties in NFT transactions. Additionally, a bug that incorrectly displayed the wallet as connected even after disconnection has been fixed. The SDK now also includes an auto-disconnect feature when users switch networks in decentralized applications.

#### NFT Marketplace

User Interface (UI) improvements have been made based on customer feedback. Additional features have been implemented, including more flexible royalty support options for NFT transactions.

### Frontend TeamÂ Updates

#### Mobile Wallet

Several improvements have been made to the mobile wallet, including a complete overhaul of modals and progress on WalletConnect integration. Layout components have also been refactored, and a new architecture has been adopted.

#### Desktop Wallet

The Desktop Wallet now supports signing of unsigned transactions, adding another layer of security for users. Version 2.1.5 has been released, incorporating these new features.

#### Explorer

The display of total amounts on transaction pages has been enhanced for better clarity. Ongoing work includes efforts to make the interface adaptable to various operating systemsâ€™ themes and to offer multi-language support.
