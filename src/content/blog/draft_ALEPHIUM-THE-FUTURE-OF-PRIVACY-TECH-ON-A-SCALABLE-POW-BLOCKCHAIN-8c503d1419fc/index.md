### **ALEPHIUM: THE FUTURE OF PRIVACY TECH ON A SCALABLE POW BLOCKCHAIN**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XuXCifctOWpbikaI)

Alephium is a pioneer PoW L1 that scales security and programmability without sacrificing decentralization to expand the possibilities for tokens, smart contracts, and dApps. Those properties, along with an engaged community, have produced a vibrant and quickly expanding ecosystem of DApps, services, tools, and builders.

### ALEPHIUM IN SHORT

**Scalability**: BlockFlow, a novel sharding algorithm, natively supports more than 10,000 transactions per second while preserving a seamless “single-chain” user experience.

**Security & programmability:** custom Virtual Machine and optimized smart contract language mitigates common attack vectors and development pitfalls, providing developers and users with a secure and useful environment.

**Decentralization & energy consumption:** Proof of Less Work is a robust consensus mechanism for achieving decentralization while reducing the energy consumption by over 87% compared to the “classicˮ Proof of Work.

**Dynamic & connected ecosystem**: Bitmain, IceRiver & others have released ASIC miners for Alephium, exponentially boosting its network hashrate and security. Alephium also integrated with DIAʼs cross-chain oracle, strengthening its position as the leading PoW smart contract platform by Total Value Locked (TVL), paving the way for further DeFi innovation. Integration with Ledger and Onekey Hardware wallets complete the recent news & expand its users horizon.

**A blooming ecosystem:** There are several dozen dApps live on network, a bridge to/from Ethereum with tens of millions in TVL (and more coming), hundreds of thousands of active addresses, NFT projects as well as a very engaged (and lovely) community! It’s very much alive.

**But that’s just the beginning**: Alephium evolves constantly, gets regular network upgrades that introduce significant improvements (like dividing the block time by 4 last time…). And Alephium is a welcoming platform for developers interested in building privacy-enhanced solutions on blockchain.

And here’s why:

### PRIVACY TECH BUILDERS UNITE!

**Start with the vision**: Alephium places a very big premium on doing things pragmatically & for the right reasons. Which is why it focuses so much on keeping the network decentralized, provides very lightweight nodes, everything is open-sourced, and it lives by KISS and builds in public. Privacy tech is (and will be) important to retain the decentralized, censorship resistant of the coming times, and Alephium welcomes builders who make it their work.

**The tech stack is privacy-ready:** Combining the natural advantages of a UTXO chain for privacy, with a security-focused asset permission system, and a dev-friendly powerful DSL language (Ralph) allows developer to focus on what matters when building, while providing with a great deal expressivity inside a secure programming paradigm.

**Schnorr**: Alephium’s cryptographic framework is fortified with Schnorr signatures, an efficient and secure alternative to traditional ECDSA signatures. Schnorr signatures provide smaller signature sizes and enable signature aggregation, enhancing transaction efficiency. Importantly, they facilitate privacy-enhancing protocols such as CoinJoin, which mixes multiple transactions to obscure their origins and destinations, thereby enhancing user privacy.

**Nostr:** Alephium also supports Nostr, an open protocol for decentralized social media. It provides a foundation for secure, censorship-resistant communication within its network and facilitates decentralized, private interactions, further demonstrating Alephium’s commitment to fostering privacy both on and off-chain.

**Tell me who your friends are:** Alephium’s vision for privacy doesn’t stop at technical features; it is actively building partnerships and expanding its ecosystem to accommodate a wide range of privacy-enhancing use cases. For instance, Alephium is one of the chains capable of using NYM’s mixnet to connect the wallet to the wallet backend with enhanced privacy.

**ZK, and more to come:** Alephium’s roadmap emphasizes expanding privacy features alongside its focus on scalability and decentralization. This includes implementing new elliptic curves to strengthen cryptographic security and support Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology, which potentially allows succinct verification of transactions without exposing sensitive data. Alephium also plans to introduce advanced signature schemes to enhance the signature aggregations. These privacy enhancements will safeguard identities and transaction details while maintaining network efficiency

**Tell us what you need!** Devs are always listening to feedback & needs from builders, the feedback loop cycle is fast & efficient.
