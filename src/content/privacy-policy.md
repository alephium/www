# Alephium Privacy Policy

_Last modified: June 10, 2024_

This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains how Alephium ("Alephium Developer", the "Company", "we", "us" or "our") collects, uses, and shares data in connection with the Alephium website (alephium.org), the Alephium wallets and all of our other properties, products, and services (the “Services”). Your use of the Services is subject to this Policy as well as our Terms of Service.

## High Level Summary

- Alephium does not collect and store personal data, such as first name, last name, street address, date of birth, email address, or IP address, in connection with your use of the Services.
- Alephium collects non-identifiable data, such as device type, browser version, etc. This is to help drive production vision, not track users.
- Alephium continues to explore methods to further protect consumers' privacy, such as opt-out prompts, migrating to privacy-centric tooling and deploying proxies to anonymize network traffic.
- Users are empowered to explore client-side privacy techniques and tools.
- Any material changes to privacy will be reflected in an updated privacy policy.

## Data We Collect

Privacy is central to everything we do. Accordingly, we aspire to be transparent about what little data we do collect. We do not maintain user accounts and do not collect and store personal data, such as your name or internet protocol (“IP”) address.

In our website at alephium.org we are using [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/), a privacy-friendly web analytics tool. No personal information (such as IP address) is collected; a hash of the IP address, User-Agent, and a random number (“salt”) is kept in the process memory for 8 hours to identify a browsing session, and is never stored to disk.There is no information stored in the browser with cookies, localStorage, or other methods. The following information can be stored:

- URL of the visited page.
- Referer header.
- Browser and system information (derived from User-Agent header or HTTP client hints; the original headers are not stored).
- Screen size.
- Country and region name derived from the IP address.
- The browser language derived from the Accept-Language header.

In our desktop and mobile wallets we are using [PostHog](https://posthog.com/). The information collected by the wallets is completely anonymous. Upon the first launch of your wallet, a unique ID is generated (for example, `vCJGCsDPrZ8WJaIKZMWjU`) which is the only identification information required. IPs or any other personal data are not collected. Only events such as button clicks and data such as number of wallets, addresses, contacts and wallet preferences are recorded. This information helps identify useful features and areas for improvement.

## How We Use Data

We use the data we collect to learn more about how users use the Services and where we can improve your experience. This data is also useful for debugging purposes.

## How We Share Data

- **Legal compliance**. We may use the information we collect as needed or requested by regulators, government entities, and law enforcement to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

We do not share your information with any third parties for any marketing purposes whatsoever.

## Third Party Cookies

## Third-Party Links and Sites

We may integrate technologies operated or controlled by other parties into parts of the Services. For example, the Services may include links that hyperlink to websites, platforms, and other services not operated or controlled by us. Please note that when you interact with these other parties, including when you leave the Site, those parties may independently collect information about you and solicit information from you. You can learn more about how those parties collect and use your data by consulting their privacy policies and other terms.

## Security

We implement and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to help protect data from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information about you. You are responsible for all of your activity on the Services, including the security of your blockchain network addresses, cryptocurrency wallets, and their cryptographic keys.

## Additional Notice to California Residents (“CCPA Notice”)

Please note that the CCPA limits these rights, for example, by prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in response to access requests and limiting the circumstances under which we must comply with a deletion request. We will respond to requests for information, access, and deletion only to the extent we are able to associate, with a reasonable effort, the information we maintain with the identifying details you provide in your request.
