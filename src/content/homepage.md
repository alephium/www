    title: Accessibility & Usability first
    subtitle: From its technical design to its interfaces, Alephium has been created
      with usability and accessibility in mind. It's made to support powerful,
      scalable yet user-friendly decentralized applications and protocols.

  blockFlowSection:
    title: "Blockflow: sharding on BTC's proven foundations"
    description: Alephium is built on the BlockFlow algorithm which delivers
      efficient and practical UTXO sharding. Inspired by distributed computing
      models, it combines DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and sharding. Much more
      lightweight than other sharding methods, BlockFlow also natively supports
      single-step cross shard transaction making Alephium user-experience just
      as convenient as any single chain platform.
    cardText: BlockFlow combines DAG and sharding to enable an efficient, secure and
      verifiable consensus algorithm.

  polwSection:
    title: Proof of Less Work (PoLW)
    description: PoLW uses a clever combination of physical work and token economics
      to dynamically adjust the work required to mine new blocks, ensuring a
      reduced energy footprint compared to classic Nakamoto PoW mining.
    cardText: Blockchain ultimately depends on its sustainability.

  smartContractSection:
    title: Smart contract design
    description: Alephium's smart contracts have been designed and implemented to be
      scalable, functional, practical with a focus on security and reduced state
      usage. Its stateful UTXO model combines the advantages of both eUTXO model
      and account model.

  vmsSection:
    title: Novel VM design
    description: Most of the modern blockchain protocols have a built-in virtual
      machine for general computing to implement useful and complex
      decentralized applications. In Alephium, we shift from a code-centric
      approach to a data-centric approach and enable access and parse
      information from data payload of UTXOs. As a result, our script system is
      as powerful as a general virtual machine.
    cardText: VMs can be a big bottleneck when it comes to Blockchain performances.
