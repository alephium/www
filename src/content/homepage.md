  blockFlowSection:
    title: 'Scalable & Sharded'
    description: "Alephium is built on a novel and complete sharding algorithm called BlockFlow. It improves on the UTXO model of BTC to make it scalable and uses DAG data structure to reach consensus between different shards. This will allow up to 10,000 Transactions Per Second (currently more than 400 TPS vs Bitcoin's 7 TPS)."
