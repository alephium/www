  blockFlowSection:
    title: "Blockflow: sharding on BTC's proven foundations"
    description: Alephium is built on the BlockFlow algorithm which delivers
      efficient and practical UTXO sharding. Inspired by distributed computing
      models, it combines DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and sharding. Being much
      more lightweight than other sharding methods, BlockFlow also natively
      supports single-step cross shard transactions, making the Alephium UX as
      smooth as any single chain platform.
    cardText: BlockFlow combines DAG and sharding to enable an efficient, secure and
      verifiable consensus algorithm.

  polwSection:
    title: Proof of Less Work (PoLW)
    description: PoLW uses a clever combination of physical work and token economics
      to dynamically adjust the work required to mine new blocks, ensuring a
      reduced energy footprint compared to classic Nakamoto PoW mining.
    cardText: Blockchain's success ultimately depends on its sustainability.

  smartContractSection:
    title: Smart contract design
    description: Alephium's smart contracts have been designed and implemented to be
      scalable, functional, practical with a focus on security and reduced state
      usage. Its stateful UTXO model combines the advantages of the UTXO model
      and the account model.

  vmsSection:
    title: Novel VM
    description: Alephium uses a simple, safe and flexible virtual machine
      designed for dApps, and more specifically DeFi. Its dedicated VM leverages
      and improves on the UTXO model to address DeFiâ€™s security issues and execution
      bottleneck. Our VM focuses on contract security and IO performance. The key
      features are its first-class token system, multiple-caller contract and
      fine-grained execution model.
    cardText: VMs can be a big bottleneck when it comes to Blockchain performances.
