title: About us
---

In 2013, during his studies at the Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne Switzerland), Cheng Wang, Alephium’s founder and core developer, started to research distributed algorithms. In 2015, he proposed the first linear time asynchronous Byzantine consensus algorithm.

As he became passionate about the scalability issues of blockchain, Cheng proposed a new sharding algorithm called BlockFlow as an elegant solution. Given the industry interest in BlockFlow, Alephium was founded in 2019 to build a decentralized blockchain based on the BlockFlow algorithm. After a couple of years of hard work, Alephium has designed and implemented a brand new blockchain from scratch, proposing a new approach to scalability, smart contracts security and the energy consumption problems of blockchain.

Alephium is the first operational sharded blockchain bringing scalability, ETH-inspired smart contracts, and improved energy efficiency to Bitcoin's proven core technologies. Alephium offers a whole new programming paradigm for decentralized applications, ideally suited for performance-oriented and secure DeFI.
