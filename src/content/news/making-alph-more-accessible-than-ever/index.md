One of the biggest barriers in crypto is onboarding. Moving from a bank account or credit card to an on-chain wallet can be a complicated, frustrating process with too many steps, stopping many users in their tracks.

That’s why Alephium has integrated Onramper, a leading fiat-to-crypto on-ramp aggregator. This integration allows users to buy ALPH seamlessly with fiat currency in a single step, eliminating unnecessary friction.

Taking over 70 data points into account, Onramper’s proprietary system intelligently connects users with their perfect onramp, giving Alephium users a seamless, one-step solution to acquire ALPH effortlessly on mobile and desktop wallets.

## Why This Integration Matters

This integration is a major improvement for both user experience and adoption, connecting traditional finance with Alephium’s on-chain ecosystem. Whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned user, Onramper and the Alephium Wallet offer a simple, efficient, and intuitive way to acquire ALPH.

Alephium is all about eliminating friction, and this integration does exactly that. With Onramper and the Alephium Wallet, users can seamlessly purchase ALPH using widely accepted payment methods, including:

- **Visa**
- **Mastercard**
- **Apple Pay**
- **Google Pay**
- **Bank Transfer**
- **And many more!**

But accessibility isn’t just about payment methods, it’s also about supporting the currencies users rely on. Beyond convenience, this integration supports **over 170 countries and 50 fiat currencies\*** for on-ramping to Alephium, making ALPH more accessible than ever. Major supported currencies include:

- **USD (United States Dollar)**
- **EUR (Euro)**
- **CHF (Swiss Franc)**
- **KRW (South Korean Won)**
- **JPY (Japanese Yen)**
- **CAD (Canadian Dollar)**
- **INR (Indian Rupee)**

We are actively working on supporting additional payment methods and expanding to key geographies such as the USA. Stay tuned for updates as we continue improving access to ALPH for everyone!

## Why an Aggregator and Multiple On-Ramp Providers?

Aggregating multiple on-ramp providers ensures global access, more payment options, better rates, and a smoother experience for our users:

- **Wider Geographic Coverage:**

  Different providers serve different regions, making ALPH accessible worldwide.

- **More Payment Options:**

  Users can choose from credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, ACH bank transfers, and wire transfers.

- **Better Conversion Rates & Lower Fees:**

  Competition among providers leads to better rates and cost savings for users.

- **Increased Redundancy & Reliability:**

  If one provider experiences downtime, others remain available.

- **Compliance & Regulatory Flexibility:**

  Multiple providers help us navigate global regulatory requirements.

Please note that, even though Onramper supports [28+ providers](https://docs.onramper.com/docs/onramp-providers), as a Layer 1 blockchain, Alephium must integrate each on-ramp provider separately. Below are the currently supported providers:

- [Alchemy Pay](https://alchemypay.org/)
- [Banxa](https://banxa.com/)
- [GateConnect](https://gate.lt/connect/)
- [TransFi](https://www.transfi.com/)

_We are continuously working to integrate more providers over time to expand our coverage and improve accessibility._

_\* Please note that geographical restrictions and supported services may vary depending on your country of citizenship. For more details, visit [Alchemy Pay](https://alchemypay.org/), [Banxa](https://banxa.com/), [GateConnect ](https://gate.lt/connect/)and [TransFi](https://www.transfi.com/)._

_\*\* Integration expected to be live by the end of March 2025._
