#### Alephium has made great progress lately and a lot of work has been put down on various repositories. It’s time for an update!

### Full-Node

For starters, 2 new versions of the full-node have been released with various fixes improving many areas. We released v1.1.5 which supports fixed-size array for our smart contract language and includes many improvements for our UTXO endpoints with better error messages, better validations, and more tests. Meaning that from this point on, the life of all developers and testers will be greatly improved during debugging and development. Also, the dependency to `HOME` environment variable was removed, fixing the confusion that would arise in some set-ups. And finally, shortly after the v1.1.5 release, we pushed out v1.1.6, which adds SHA256 checksum for build artifacts.

### Desktop-Wallet

The desktop-wallet reached v1.0.2 with a new “localhost” preset to run the stack locally. This release also fixes some connection issues and provides much better error management.

### Alephium-JS

Our JavaScript SDK now has 100% test coverage. And we released v1.0.1 of the alephium-js node package.

### One-liner Alephium Miner

A script to install the Alephium Miner with only one command was published. To accompany this achievement, we created a video tutorial to demonstrate the ease to get your miner up and running that this script provides.

### Wiki

Last but not least, we moved the documentation to our own wiki. This allows us to have much better control on the navigation and the UX of the wiki itself. The repo for the wiki remains the same and all kind souls with a little spare time on their hands are welcome to contribute to it:
