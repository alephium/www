We are thrilled to announce that Alephium (ALPH) is now supported by [Tangem wallet](https://tangem.com/en/). This integration allows ALPH holders to securely store, receive, and manage their assets with Tangem’s innovative card-based hardware wallets, equipped with NFC technology and compatible with both Android and iOS devices.

### Enhanced Security and Convenience

Tangem Wallets utilize a powerful, EAL6+ CC-certified chip to securely generate private keys that never leave the card, ensuring the highest level of protection. Users can link up to three cards to one wallet, providing redundancy and security. With no need for cables, plugins, batteries, or chargers, managing ALPH on the go has become quite easy.

Tangem Wallet joins the existing suite of hardware wallets supporting Alephium, including Ledger, OneKey, Goldshell wallet and SafePal, providing users with a broader range of secure custody options. Currently only ALPH is supported, without additional token or NFT support.

Tangem Wallet supports over 13,000 cryptocurrencies across more than 75 blockchain networks, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and now Alephium. With a 25-year warranty, ALPH holders can enjoy long-term security and peace of mind.

Notably, Tangem has maintained a flawless security record, with zero breaches reported across over two million cards manufactured. This level of reliability aligns with Alephium’s mission of delivering a scalable, efficient, and secure blockchain ecosystem.
