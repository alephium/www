**On December 1st in 2022, the community was encouraged to [enter a contest](/news/post/alephium-flux-tutorial-contest-81054caf926) to produce the best tutorial about how to run an [Alephium full node](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/) on [FLUX](https://runonflux.io/). The results came in and we are pleased withÂ them.**

It might seem like a trivial exercise but decentralization is not only about tools: in order to happen the skills required need to be evenly distributed. By participating the contestants have helped their peers to run their own full-node: everybody wins. A big thank you to everyone who participated.

## WE GOT AÂ WINNER!

Actuallyâ€¦ we got several. Picking the champion was no easy task, we loved your creations! But three contestants stood out sharing 1st place in different categories. Four runners up share the 2nd place and two contestants share the 3rd place. Everyone wins, quite literally.

## The Process

A jury of team-members from Flux and Alephium collaborated to pick the winner. The judges observed technical depth, accuracy, visual form. They also made sure the contributions adhere to [the rules and submissions guidelines](/news/post/alephium-flux-tutorial-contest-81054caf926#6cf2) and applications were bound to the [eligibility criterias](https://github.com/alephium/community/blob/master/RewardProgramRules.md#eligibility-criteria). **The winners will soon be contacted individually and asked for the necessary information to receive their prizes.**
