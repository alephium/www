_Regularly, we put the spotlight on an active member of the Alephium community.

_He is an engineer and family guy who was impressed with Alephium tech. Always helpful in Discord and actively promoting Alephium on Twitter. You know this about_ [Ryan](https://twitter.com/RyanRit91769208)_, but there is a lot more, and we tell you here!_

## What can we call you, and where should we picture you?

I’m a simple person; you can call me Ryan because that is my name ;)

## Tell us about yourself/your persona

I am an engineer for my day job. I.e., why my discord handle is “Ryannn”. I try to understand everything logically/literally. I have a young family, my wife and I just had our first child ~6 months ago.

## How did you find out about Alephium?

I learned about Alephium in Feb 2022 when GPURisers uploaded a YouTube video on Alephium / how to mine it. From there, I joined the Alph discord / and continued to read & follow the project.

## What excites you about Alephium?

I have participated in the crypto space since ~2017. When actively investing in projects, I strive to find projects that meet two criteria: \#1 amazing tech and \#2 a transparent core team. What excites me about Alephium? While it’s easy to find many projects with great tech or a transparent team, it is incredibly rare to find both attributes in my experience. I believe Alephium is solving a real-world problem with its tech, and it's only a matter of time before the masses understand what Alephium has to offer.

## What excites you about the future of Alephium?

Community devs / dapps! I can’t wait to watch the Alephium ecosystem explode! It’s already starting with Ayin (first community DEX), and I know of at least 2 users in Discord building an NFT Marketplace.

## How do you contribute to the Alephium ecosystem?

I am not a technical person/dev. I try to contribute by spreading the word about Alephium on Twitter / staying active in Discord to welcome new users / answer questions.

## What do you like to do in your free time?

I pride myself that I enjoy learning — whether it's finance stuff or engineering-related topics where I try to understand how something works, I really try to embrace an “always learning” mentality.

## Any hobbies?

Both my wife and I are family-oriented. If we aren’t doing “family” activities at the lake, travelling, hiking etc. I enjoy hunting & riding my dirt bike. I used to race motocross competitively (in my younger days; I'm not a professional). Now, I enjoy recreational riding on trails with friends & family.
