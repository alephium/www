## Prizes for a total of 10’000 ALPH 💰

🐰 It’s quite a trip down the YouTube-hole to watch the [video content created around the topic of Alephium](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alephium). Miners are showing us so much love, and there are a lot of really on point tutorials. It’s overwhelming to be frank!

**However, we’re missing a good video-introduction to Alephium and we’d like your help. To this end, we’re launching a video creation contest for an Alephium introduction.**

---

## 🎬The video

### _What?_

We need an accessible video introduction to Alephium. It should at least cover all the basics included in the [“Welcome to Alephium” Medium article](/news/post/welcome-to-alephium-alph-48dfb72aa458).

### _For who?_

The video should target an audience of newcomers, who aren’t necessarily tech savvy and haven’t heard about Alephium before. This audience needs a simple yet comprehensive overview of the project.

### _By You!_

Beyond these guidelines, the rest is up to you. Create a 3D animation, a cartoon or do voice-over with fancy slides. Let your imagination and creativity take the lead and feel free to throw yourself in the mix. This video may be about Alephium, it is produced by You. We want to see that personal touch of yours in the end-result.
