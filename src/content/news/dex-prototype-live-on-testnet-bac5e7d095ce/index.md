#### Proof-of-Concept to showcase dApps building on¬†Alephium

Alephium is excited to announce the release of a DEX prototype!

You can access it here: [](https://alephium.github.io/alephium-dex) üîó[https://github.com/alephium/alephium-dex/tree/master/contracts](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-dex/tree/master/contracts)

While this prototype is not meant to be a production-ready project, it is an excellent sample of what can be built on Alephium.

The core devs have written and tested the contracts extensively to ensure their reliability and efficiency. The community should find them easy to fork and use as a starting point for their own projects.

To showcase and test the prototype, a very simple UI is available. You can access it here: [https://alephium.github.io/alephium-dex](https://alephium.github.io/alephium-dex)

_Please note that the UI is provided for testing convenience purposes but isn‚Äôt meant as a demonstration of the intended user experience of production-ready applications on Alephium. When building the prototype, the focus_ **_was exclusively on the contracts and ensuring a reliable base_** _for people to build on._

### How to interact with the DEX via the¬†UI

To connect with the DEX on Testnet, you need first to install the Alephium browser extension wallet:

Once on the Testnet, make sure to create or use a wallet with an address in group 0 to be able to connect to the DEX.

#### Connecting to the¬†DEX

#### Requesting test¬†\$ALPH

Don‚Äôt have \$ALPH in your wallet? You can request some right from the wallet! Click ‚ÄúAdd funds‚Äù on the main page and then ‚ÄúRequest \$ALPH‚Äù. You will receive 12 Testnet \$ALPH in a few minutes.
