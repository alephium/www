Alephium is very happy to announce that the mobile wallet for iOS and Android are ready for beta testing, and calls for user feedback!

The mobile wallet is the third developed by the team (after the desktop wallet and the browser extension), it marks a significant step in making Alephium more widely accessible and easier to use on the go.

A first phase of internal testing has been completed, and the app has gone through initial approval stages on the appstore. We can now invite people to install the app.

#### **For iOS **users

If you already have the TestFlight app, you will be able to install the Alephium Mobile Wallet app directly. If you don’t, please install TestFlight, and the wallet afterwards.
