[Yulius](https://www.instagram.com/yuliuskristianto9/) _is a new member of our community but has done a lot already!_ [He](https://web.facebook.com/yulius.kristianto.96/) _takes care of all Indonesian translations and is always helpful on Discord. Check the interview to know more about_ [him](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJTaLoG9ao8oxayCZR__DHw)_!_

## What can we call you and where should we picture you?

Let me introduce myself. My full name is Yulius Kurniawan Kristianto, you can call me Chris, and I live in the Republic of Indonesia, one of the most beautiful countries in the world.

## Can you tell us about yourself/your persona?

I was born in 1995. My main job is as a computer technician. In my spare time, I am also active in serving the community in social organizations and church services in my area.

I also often search for historical sites in my country, such as traces of railways and the history of the archipelago kingdom. I document them on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJTaLoG9ao8oxayCZR__DHw) so that they can be useful for the next generation!

## How did you find out about Alephium?

I found the Alephium on a [Twitter post from BitMart in April 2023](https://twitter.com/BitMartExchange/status/1646579300672438287).

At that time, I was immediately interested in learning about the Alephium. In my mind, I was thinking: “Wow this project is very good!”. Then I opened Alephium’s [GitHub page](https://github.com/alephium), and that’s when I found out that the community could also contribute to the Alephium ecosystem. And then, I decided to join the [Alephium discord channel](/discord), and start contributing to the Alephium ecosystem.

Based on my experience as a contributor to other crypto community projects from 2015 until now, I started my first contribution to the Alephium ecosystem as a translator for the Alephium Desktop!

## What excites you about Alephium?

Alephium is an extraordinary protocol, an amazing community, a solid team, and very friendly to all communities worldwide. Fast response, very innovative, and decentralized: that is what I see and like there.

## What inspired you to form the Indonesian Alephium Medium Page?

I was inspired by a community member named [Oheka](https://twitter.com/Oheka32), who actively contributed to translating articles from Alephium into French. As he also created the [Alephium French medium page](https://medium.com/alephiumfr), I decided to follow him by creating an [Alephium medium page for the Indonesian community](https://medium.com/@Alph-Indonesia). I hope that it can be useful as a means of education about the Alephium ecosystem for Indonesian society.

## Are you planning to create other social media profiles (Facebook, Twitter, etc)?

I created a Facebook page named _ALEPHIUM INDONESIA COMMUNITY_ a few weeks ago,

> [https://www.facebook.com/alephiumid](https://www.facebook.com/alephiumid)

because Oheka also gave me this tip (to be on other social media) on the \#lounge channel on the Alephium discord server. This is a Alephium Facebook page in Indonesian, to record the progress of our project together.

## What excites you about the future of Alephium?

I can’t wait to see the Alephium ecosystem become world-famous! It already started with [Ayin](http://ayin.app) (first community DEX). The core contributors have done amazing things in developing wallets for mobile devices, and wallet extensions for web browsers, and worked with [Zealy](https://zealy.io/c/alephium/questboard) & B[lockflow DAO](https://twitter.com/Blockflow_DAO), and I know there are at least 2 users on Discord who are building NFT Marketplaces.

My hope is that Alephium will increasingly become the largest crypto project in the world!

## How do you contribute to the Alephium ecosystem?

I contribute to the Alephium Ecosystem as an Indonesian Translator on Alephium Wallet Apps (Desktop/Mobile/Extension Wallets) instances.

Also, whenever I can, I will try to fix any small issue I see. I try to contribute by spreading the word about Alephium on Twitter Alephium Indonesia, while being helpful on the Alephium Discord Server.

## What do you like to do in your free time? Any hobbies?

I use it to keep learning and doing things that are useful for the environment where I live, such as helping & serving others in the social community. I really like travelling and reading books.
