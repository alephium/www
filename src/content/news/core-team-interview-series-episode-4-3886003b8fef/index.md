_For its team, Alephium is privileging agility and efficiency over hyper-growth. The project does stay at a human size not because it is more efficient, but because Alephium strives to be a decentralized, community-driven project. This means the project in itself is much larger than a team can ever be. Communication, trust, openness, and transparency are paramount in such a setup._

_To shed some light on who we are and what we do, we decided to share a little about ourselves with the community through a small series of interviews. Read the_ [1st](/news/post/core-team-interview-series-episode-1-3472f8295af6)_,_ [2nd](/news/post/core-team-interview-series-episode-2-bec6e6908d2f)_, and_ [3rd part](/news/post/core-team-interview-series-episode-3-64b6dacc1459)_._

Like many people, I learned about crypto in 2017 when a broker tried to sell me some Bitcoins. I realized that there had to be a better way to be part of it all and started looking into it for myself. I found the entire space quite exciting and decided I would love to work with it. It was then in 2018 that I joined [Lykke](https://lykke.com/), a Cryptoexchange established in 2016, as the Head of Customer Success and expanded my knowledge in various areas. Lykke is
