**Welcome to Alephium Team Talks.** 

In this interview article, we're pulling back the curtain on a multi-talented individual who wears many hats in the Alephium ecosystem. Our Operations, Ecosystem & Marketing Specialist, a true Swiss Army Knife for the team. Some of you will already know them for their outstanding community contributions and tools. Introducing, **[Baby](https://x.com/babyxDDD)**.

We'll be talking to Baby about bridging the gap between community, development, and strategy to build a stronger and more vibrant Alephium.

## **Can you share how you first found Alephium and how that experience led to you becoming part of the Alephium team?**

I first came across Alephium in 2022, right after Ethereum moved to PoS. As a miner I started looking into what else was happening in the PoW space, and Alephium immediately stood out for its wallets, its innovative technology, and its overall potential.

I have been involved in the Alephium community and ecosystem since then. In February I joined the BlockFlow DAO, became a Community Moderator in March, and later joined Alephium's core team officially as an intern in May.

By the time I joined in an official capacity, I was already working closely with several team members, especially Alephium's COO Maud, so the transition felt completely natural and none of us needed an introduction!

We were already working together, and my path was completely community driven and shaped by the work we were doing long before I joined Alephium's team officially.

## **How would you describe your current role at Alephium and the areas you focus on today?**

My role has evolved a lot since joining the team. I now cover general operations at Alephium and work actively where marketing and ecosystem overlap, helping connect the work happening inside the team with what is happening across the ecosystem. My favorite part is publishing this as content through Ecosystem Highlights!

## **Looking into the future at Alephium, what do you find the most exciting?**

While I stay focused on developing BabyPoolTool/AlphScan and I’m really excited for it and hope to bring something great for the Alephium community with it, I’m also really excited about Alephium’s upcoming Core dApp. 

Alephium is a PoW Layer 1 with smart contracts, and that combination creates a natural loop between miners and stakers, bringing DeFi activity and PoW security together in one ecosystem. It is a direction with a lot of potential and something I have been excited and vocal about for a long time, so I’m happy to see it take shape with Alephium’s Core dApp!

**Thank you, Baby!**
