Welcome to Alephium Team Talks, where we introduce you to the people building the future of Web3. Today, we're taking a deep dive into the code with YY, our Ecosystem Developer. 

In this exclusive interview, we'll uncover how she tackles complex problems, streamlines processes, and uses her skills to make the Alephium network more efficient and secure. Get ready for a glimpse behind the scenes of how a decentralized project runs.

### Can you describe a typical day in your role? What kind of tasks fall under "Ecosystem" in the context of a blockchain project?

Currently, on the technical side, I am responsible for upgrading alph.land. This website was previously operated by the community and only provided a simple dApp list feature. A few months ago, we began to take over its operation. Carla, Baby, and I have completely redesigned and re-planned the website’s UI/UX, search functionality, content presentation, and overall logic structure. We referenced the designs of other mainstream ecosystem websites from different blockchains. At the same time, we are adding bounties as a major feature. The new version is planned to be launched early next year.

Before that, my main focus was assisting Ratko in developing the ambassador program system and its supporting applications. We iterated on Guards and Squires every two weeks, adjusting scoring rules, bot commands, and frontend pages based on user submissions. I regularly reviewed user data. If there were minor issues, I fixed them the same day. But for more complex problems, I would batch them together and handle them later.

In addition, I’m responsible for maintaining the grants system, conducting the initial review of grant applications, and performing milestone checks once grants are approved. On a daily basis, I also manage community-facing tasks such as the Chinese Telegram group, Chinese Twitter account, and the WeChat official account.

When it comes to the “ecosystem,” every L1 chain strives to build one. Beyond the development of the chain itself, we want to see many applications, developers, and users gathering around Alephium. That’s what I consider part of the ecosystem.

For developers, whether it’s major DeFi projects, RWA projects, or small utility applications, whenever we see someone with an idea to build on Alephium, we welcome it and are willing to offer support, whether technical, future investment-related, or in terms of revenue planning. 

We basically receive some applications almost every week. I am responsible for reviewing the applicants’ technical background, their GitHub repositories, and evaluating whether the proposed technical development already has existing solutions, whether it is duplicative, and whether the development approach is practical.

At the moment, we are more welcoming of grant applications in the DeFi space.

For users, for example, some might want to track how much gas is burned daily or how much $ALPH whales are holding in their wallets. These needs should be met, so we look for developers to build such applications to satisfy different user demands. This is what we do to build the ecosystem.

The above are on the online side. On the offline side, I think we should host more small community meetups in different regions and countries, as well as introductory technical workshops for developers, to help grow local community groups and expand our active user base. This is included in Ratko’s ambassador program, and I’m really looking forward to seeing the related developments.

### Can you describe one of the most interesting or challenging ecosystem development tasks you've worked on? What problem did it solve for the team or the community?

The most challenging part is that I developed the entire bounty platform myself. I had to design two different flows from both the user and sponsor perspectives, since the two roles have different needs.

Anyone, whether an individual or a project team, can post tasks on the platform and pay rewards in $ALPH. For example, an ecosystem project could publish a bounty asking Twitter users to test a new feature and share related posts.

My hope is that it becomes a platform where developers, projects, and active users can interact. For users, it offers the simplest way to participate in the Alephium ecosystem and earn small rewards. For projects, it serves as both a promotional tool and a way to find an interested user base.

The bounty platform is now in alph.land as a feature.

### Besides the main development tasks mentioned above, do you also work on other things?

An example of automation I worked on is optimizing Alephium’s grant application process. When a user applies for a grant, they want to know whether their application was successful, whether they can access a document to review it, and what exactly they wrote in their application. 

For us, we want each application to be automatically saved as a document, correctly named, and stored in a specific location. We also want AI to generate a summary for us, and we need to be notified immediately when a new grant is submitted, with the ability to access it anytime. 

All of these processes are automated, which reduces the workload for grant reviewers.

### What new skills have you had to learn since joining the team? How is working on a decentralized team different from other roles you’ve had in the past?

I’ve learned some DevOps knowledge to make it easier for me to deploy bots on my own. I also became familiar with the Ralph SDK and API endpoints. I have to say, our API is very convenient to use. I’ve also studied some blockchain fundamentals, such as sharding, in order to better understand the similarities and differences between Alephium and other blockchains, as well as to write technical articles. 

To learn more about other L1 ecosystems, I’ve also participated in hackathons on other chains, where I explored their contract languages and related tools.

Since becoming a programmer, I’ve always worked remotely. As long as the work, meaning content, reporting, deliverables, collaboration with team members, and timelines is all clearly defined, this job is no different from any other. 

Earlier this year at the Alephium hackathon in France, I met Maud, Bertrand, Hongchao, Polto and some Dao members. During Berlin Blockchain Week this June, I met Cheng and Hongchao at the Alephium offline event. I hope to meet the whole team and the DAO members at future events!

### Where do you see the future of Ecosystem in the Web3 space?

The Web3 ecosystem will continue to thrive.

I think bringing a broad base of Web2 users into Web3 and enabling them to use Web3 tools or payments, will require the collective efforts of ecosystem members. It will also include technical education and the optimization of tools. 

Our journey is still long, but we will never stop.

*Wow, thank you YY! What a terrific interview, right?*
