> What major trends are you currently observing in the global hashrate market, and how is Iceriver adapting its strategy to align with these trends? With the ongoing debate between PoW (Proof of Work) and PoS (Proof of Stake), what are Iceriver’s thoughts on the future of PoW networks?

**ICERIVER**: Firstly, there is the concentration and specialization of hashrate. As mining difficulty increases and the industry matures, hashrate is gradually concentrating in large mining farms and among specialized miners. This means that the demands for mining machine performance and efficiency are higher. ICERIVER helps miners maintain an edge in this competitive environment by developing efficient and energy-saving ASIC miners. We are dedicated to improving the hashrate to power consumption ratio, allowing miners to operate more efficiently and reduce mining costs.

Secondly, there’s the demand for environmental protection and energy efficiency. As global attention to environmental issues and energy efficiency grows, miners and investors increasingly focus on equipment's energy efficiency. ICERIVER actively responds to this trend by developing low-power, high-performance miners to meet market demand for energy-efficient devices. Our product designs focus on improving performance and reducing energy consumption and carbon footprints, promoting sustainable mining practices.

Lastly, there is the rise of home miners and individual users. While large mining farms dominate global hash power, we also see growing market demand from individual and home miners. To cater to this trend, ICERIVER has developed compact mining machines suitable for home environments. These devices are designed to be compact, easy to operate, and low in power consumption, making it easier for individual users to participate in mining.

Despite the significant attention that PoS has received in some blockchain projects, we continue to believe in the long-term value of PoW networks. PoW networks offer unparalleled security and decentralization, maintaining a crucial position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. ICERIVER will continue to support PoW networks and optimize our mining machines to ensure miners can achieve the best possible returns from these networks.

> At some point, Proof of less work is going to kick in and it will have an influence on the hashrate market of Alephium. What’s your expectation for it?

**ICERIVER**: With the gradual implementation of PoLW, the network will dynamically adjust hash power based on demand, meaning that hash power may no longer grow linearly but rather be optimized according to the actual needs of the network. This will allow miners to allocate resources more efficiently and maintain network security while reducing energy consumption.

PoLW will help optimize miner reward distribution, reducing unnecessary energy consumption. This will enhance miners’ profit margins, especially in scenarios where costs like electricity are high, making Alephium mining a more sustainable option.

As PoLW is applied, Alephium’s hash power market may experience a more balanced competitive environment. Small-scale and home miners will be able to compete more effectively under this mechanism, participating in network maintenance and mining without solely relying on large-scale hash power investment.

Overall, we are optimistic about the future of PoLW, believing it will drive the Alephium network towards more efficient and sustainable development. We will continue to monitor the practical impact of this mechanism and adjust our products and strategies in response to market changes.

> Alephium is one of the few Proof of Work chain with a completely functional smart contract/dapps ecosystem. That allows for different economic incentives & dynamics than what we’re used to in other POW ecosystems, as miners can directly reinvest their rewards in an ecosystem built on top of the chain. How do you see that altering the mining market?

**ICERIVER**: The fully functional smart contracts and dApps ecosystem of Alephium introduces new economic incentives and dynamics to the PoW ecosystem. In traditional PoW ecosystems, miners primarily earn income from mining rewards. However, in Alephium’s ecosystem, miners can directly reinvest their mining rewards into smart contracts and dApps, providing additional economic benefits through this reinvestment mechanism. This approach transforms mining from simply earning rewards into participating in broader economic activities, enhancing miner engagement and involvement.

By reinvesting rewards into the ecosystem, miners become more invested in the long-term development and health of the network. This investment behavior promotes more ecosystem building and application development, thereby strengthening network stability and security. Miners’ reinvestment actions will support the development of more dApps and smart contracts, leading to more innovations and application scenarios. As the ecosystem expands, Alephium is likely to attract more developers and users, driving the growth of the entire ecosystem.

When considering reinvestment, miners will pay more attention to the long-term development prospects of the network and ecosystem. This focus may influence miners to consider network technological development and application prospects when choosing mining strategies and making investment decisions, thereby impacting the landscape and competitive strategies of the mining market.

Overall, Alephium’s smart contracts and dApps ecosystem will bring more innovative opportunities and economic incentives to the PoW mining market, fostering close collaboration between miners, developers, and users, further promoting the healthy development of the network and the prosperity of the ecosystem.

> Technically, did you encounter any unique challenges with our hashing algorithm, Blake3? Is Alephium the first chain for which you’ve created a miner using this algorithm, or have there been others?

**ICERIVER**: Blake3 is an efficient hashing algorithm, but implementing it in ASIC miners requires extensive optimization to ensure that the miners can maintain high performance while minimizing energy consumption. We have devoted significant research and development efforts to chip design and algorithm implementation to achieve optimal performance. Compared to traditional hashing algorithms like SHA-256, Blake3 has different computational characteristics. This requires us to consider specific hardware optimizations in the miner design to efficiently handle the computational tasks associated with Blake3.

Alephium represents our first ASIC product based on the Blake3 algorithm. This process has been an important technical challenge for us but also provided valuable experience and opportunities. Our implementation of Blake3 has not only enhanced our technical prowess in this field but also laid a solid foundation for similar projects in the future.
