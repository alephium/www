#### _Spread the word about the bridge & share 3’000 \$ALPH in prize!_

_The bridge has launched two weeks ago, there’s been more than_ <a href="https://explorer.bridge.alephium.org/" ><em>400 transfers since</em></a>_, it has more than_ <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/alephium-bridge" ><em>1.2M in TVL</em></a> _and wrapped \$ALPH has more than 500_ <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x590f820444fa3638e022776752c5eef34e2f89a6" ><em>holders</em></a> _on ethereum!_

Alephium’s core contributors have released a lot of content on the bridge, from the <a href="/news/post/the-alephium-bridge-a787d90b2e4a" >main article explaining the way it works</a>, to multiple threads on topics such as <a href="https://x.com/alephium/status/1726556042425995760?s=20" >the faucet</a>, the different ways to use it, <a href="https://twitter.com/alephium/status/1725164466868801848" >which tokens</a> can be easily bridged, the <a href="https://x.com/alephium/status/1729149731761537296?s=20" >explorer</a> or a <a href="https://x.com/alephium/status/1727704331389194330?s=20" >tutorial</a> on how to use it.

Our partners from the <a href="https://twitter.com/alephium/status/1725439073052168293" >ecosystem</a>, the BlockFlow Alliance DAO, <a href="https://www.ayin.app/" >Ayin</a>, <a href="https://deadrare.io/" >Deadrare</a> and <a href="https://walph.io/" >Walph</a> have all created great content too. But that’s not all, the community has & other influencers too!

To reward that activity, and to offer additional spread to that great content, the Blockflow DAO has joined Alephium to setup an incentivized <a href="https://zealy.io/" >Zealy</a> quest sprint!

The <a href="/news/post/welcome-blockflow-alliance-dao-cd74a949f98b" >Blockflow DAO</a> ambitions to _“be the voice of the_ <a href="https://twitter.com/alephium" ><em>@alephium</em></a> _community and contribute to the growth of its ecosystem.”._ They have taken a number of fantastic initiatives from writing great content to advocating for \$ALPH relentlessly, participating in AMAs, etc… You can find them on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/747741246667227157/1156214551939919962" >Discord</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/Blockflow_DAO" >Twitter</a>. They are an independent and valued partner for the Alephium core-team, and it’s just the beginning!

**How does the sprint work?**

You need an account on Zealy.io & to be part of Alephium’s community there. Then you get XP by accomplishing quests. Some are one-shots, others can be done either daily or weekly to get more!

Some are automatically validated, others need to be manually checked, please be patient as we carry along.

You’ll find a dedicated sprint leaderboard, where you can track your progress.
