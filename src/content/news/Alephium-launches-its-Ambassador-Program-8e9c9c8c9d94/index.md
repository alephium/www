Following the success of our previous community initiatives, we’re thrilled to introduce the next chapter in Alephium’s community engagement: the Ambassador program!

### **The Evolution of Alephium’s Community Engagement**

At Alephium, since the beginning of our journey, we’ve been in close contact with our community and have evolved from its feedback and help, as we are today.

In the past 2 years, the <a href="https://github.com/alephium/community/blob/master/Grant%26RewardProgram.md" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://github.com/alephium/community/blob/master/Grant%26RewardProgram.md" rel="noopener" target="_blank">community rewards</a> have allowed us to <a href="https://medium.com/@alephium/one-year-of-community-contributions-b3142b243e3e" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@alephium/one-year-of-community-contributions-b3142b243e3e" target="_blank">reward community members</a> for their awesome contributions (of which there are many!). But as we continue to grow and evolve, we recognize the need for a more structured and inclusive approach to community engagement.

### **Enter the Ambassador program!**

The Ambassador program is an opportunity for motivated Alephium community members to participate in shaping the future of the project.

There are a number of roles for anyone who is enthusiastic about community management, content creation, social media events, tech support and more. Ambassadors will work in close collaboration with the core contributors

### **Who can become an Alephium Ambassador?**

Everyone!

The Alephium community is rich and diverse, it’s full of blockchain enthusiasts, developers, content creators, miners and even some _moonbois_!. If you believe in Alephium’s mission and think you can amplify our voice in your topic, region or on a global scale, we want you!

### **What are the objectives of the Ambassador Program?**

The ambassador program has 3 objectives:

1 — Increase the reach of Alephium’s news, tech & documentation,

2 — Improve our ability to meaningfully engage with the community,

3 — Augment/complement our capabilities in terms of mediums, languages & geographic zones.

### **Who are we looking for?**

**Content Creators** — Are you a good writer, a threadoooor, a videographer, a podcast host, a fantastic tutorial educator or any other medium creator prone to spread Alephium’s story? Are you a dev and good at producing documentation? This is for you.

**Animators/Moderators** — Help to keep the conversations going. Alephium needs people working with and interacting with users in its channels to ensure knowledge sharing and a good experience for all.

**Local community builders & translators** — Be our Community Builder in your location. Set up meets, build Alephium’s profile, and share ideas on how you can get Alephium to your community. Organize a hackathon! And/or translate Alephium’s content and applications into a specific language.

And more… (any other idea? Send it to us!)

### **What’s the process for becoming an ambassador?**

![](image_3ef6a74878.jpg)

The first program will onboard up to 10 Ambassadors for the first cohort.

Please submit your candidacy <a href="https://forms.gle/e4BVqssCHPVnGpWS7" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://forms.gle/e4BVqssCHPVnGpWS7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> by the 20th of January, 2024.

Alephium will evaluate the submissions and reach out to all applicants via email with feedback on their applications. Those who will be accepted in the first cohort will then be onboarded into the program. We will re-open the program again once we gather our learnings from the first cohort.

To be eligible to participate in the program, Ambassador applicants will need to be willing to commit for at least 3 months, as well as pass some eligibility criteria.

If you have more questions, please email <a href="mailto:community@alephium.org" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="mailto:community@alephium.org" target="_blank">community@alephium.org</a>.

### **Program Structure and Perks**

Ambassadors will be rewarded based on a quantitative and qualitative appreciation of their contribution by Alephium. When applying for the program, make sure to consider this information in combination with the time you are willing to dedicate to the project.

**Rewards **— Each ambassador will be remunerated, and formal agreements are required. (so you’ll need to be KYC’d). A maximum total of 5000\$ worth of \$ALPH per month will be allocated to the ambassadors program. Individual ambassadors will be remunerated at the discretion of Alephium’s team according to the quality of their contributions.

**Swag** — Vouchers to our Alephium online store will allow you to represent the project in style, or treat your local community.

**In-house collaboration **— A direct line of communication to the Alephium core contributors! And special discord roles and channels.

**NFT Collection** — We’re preparing a special, unique collection of NFTs for Ambassadors. It’s going to be awesome!

### **What If I don’t make it but still want to be involved?**

It’s ok! You have 2 more ways to still contribute and be rewarded!

First, you can still claim community rewards, with two important differences:

- you will now need to signal to us your content through <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaSouXl-Hwd_lZohwgysqk-8whc9bydHuVpSCr1C6IoDHuoA/viewform" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaSouXl-Hwd_lZohwgysqk-8whc9bydHuVpSCr1C6IoDHuoA/viewform" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this form</a>.
- the scope of things that will be rewarded will be narrowed down. Only the out-of-the-ordinary / most extraordinary proposals will be awarded through the community rewards program going forward.

Second, we will ramp up our use of the <a href="https://zealy.io/c/alephium/questboard" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://zealy.io/c/alephium/questboard" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zealy quest platform</a>, giving monthly rewards to the most active & efficient users! We are still designing that program and will update you here when it’s done.

So, what are you waiting for? Ready to join us to advance the cause of Alephium? Start <a href="https://forms.gle/e4BVqssCHPVnGpWS7" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://forms.gle/e4BVqssCHPVnGpWS7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>!
