#### Are you sure you have everything updated? A lot has been done since the <a href="https://medium.com/@alephium/the-leman-upgrade-2-232e3374abc4" data-href="https://medium.com/@alephium/the-leman-upgrade-2-232e3374abc4">previous announcement</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/@alephium/the-leman-upgrade-ama-most-relevant-topics-and-questions-1fbbc68d4237" data-href="https://medium.com/@alephium/the-leman-upgrade-ama-most-relevant-topics-and-questions-1fbbc68d4237">‚ÄúHard‚Äù Talk</a> held in January, and this post is an invitation for you to update your¬†nodes.

February was a productive month with the release of the Full Node `v1.7.0`. After intensive testing, it is considered to be the last stable version before the Leman Network Upgrade.

The full node `v1.7.0` possesses all the Leman Upgrade features but they are not activated on the mainnet. The full node `v2.0` or the Leman Upgrade version, will essentially be the same as `v1.7.0` with an activation timestamp for the Leman Upgrade features on the mainnet.

Deploying `v1.7.0` across the network will allow assessing whether any patches are necessary before the release of `v2.0`. It will also indicate the propagation time of the update across the network which will help set a realistic activation timestamp for the Leman Network Upgrade.

### Here is what you need to¬†do!

#### Downloads

Who & What:

**Regular user:** Don‚Äôt need to do anything, but it is recommended to have the latest Desktop Wallet (or reach out to your wallet provider to verify if it is up to date)

**Miners:** latest Full Node

**Users running Full Node locally:** latest Full Node

**Users running Full Node and Explorer Backend locally:** latest Full Node and Explorer Backend

**Users running Full Node externally:**

- Dappnode: There is nothing to do if you‚Äôre running the node with the auto-update option checked! If not, you must go to the alephium package and click the upgrade/update button.
- Flux: There is nothing to do.

**Services providers (exchanges, wallet providers, etc):** latest Full Node and Explorer Backend (if necessary)

#### Full Node:¬†v1.7.1

Download it here: üîó <a href="https://github.com/alephium/alephium/releases/tag/v1.7.1" data-href="https://github.com/alephium/alephium/releases/tag/v1.7.1">https://github.com/alephium/alephium/releases/tag/v1.7.1</a>

This release is backward compatible with the current Mainnet, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about compatibility issues. Download the¬†`.jar` file from the GitHub page.

#### Explorer-backend v1.13.0

Download it here: üîó <a href="https://github.com/alephium/explorer-backend/releases/tag/v1.13.0" data-href="https://github.com/alephium/explorer-backend/releases/tag/v1.13.0">https://github.com/alephium/explorer-backend/releases/tag/v1.13.0</a>

This additional download is only needed for those running the explorer backend locally. However, it is mandatory for compatibility with full node `v1.7.0`. If that is the case, download it from the GitHub page.

### Next Steps

The Leman Network Upgrade is closer than ever! Here is what you can expect next:

- Patches release, if necessary.
- Setup the activation timestamp and release full node `v2.0`
- Propagation `v2.0` of the full node across the majority of the network before the activation timestamp.
- Completion of the Leman Upgrade!
