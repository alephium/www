After bringing price oracles to Alephium, DIA now introduces [Verifiable Random Function (VRF) oracles](https://docs.alephium.org/infrastructure/Oracles/#randomness-oracles) to the ecosystem. This integration enhances trustless randomness generation for a variety of decentralized applications, including gaming, lotteries, and NFT distributions.

### What is VRF and How Does It Work?

A **Verifiable Random Function (VRF)** is a cryptographic method used to generate random values that are tamper-proof and publicly verifiable. Unlike traditional randomness sources, VRFs ensure that results are unpredictable while allowing anyone to verify their authenticity.

DIA’s VRF solution fetches randomness from multiple sources, ensuring high security and decentralization. This guarantees that applications depending on randomness — such as GameFi, DeFi, and fair draws — can operate with full transparency and integrity.

### Unlocking New Possibilities with DIA VRF on Alephium

With this integration, Alephium developers can now leverage DIA’s battle-tested VRF oracles, further expanding the ecosystem’s capabilities:

- **Fair and Secure Gaming:** Enable tamper-proof randomness in blockchain-based games.
- **Trustless Lotteries:** Ensure provably fair random draws without centralized control.
- **Dynamic NFT Minting and Traits:** Introduce randomness into NFT attributes, drops, and evolutions.
- **Randomized DeFi Mechanics:** Implement random selection mechanisms for staking rewards and liquidity mining.

### What DIA’s Oracles Bring to Alephium

- **Real-Time Asset Price Feeds:** Secure, accurate, and constantly updated price feeds for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and more.
- **Customizable Data Sources:** Developers can select specific pricing methodologies, sources, and update mechanisms tailored to their use cases.
- **Verifiable Randomness (VRF):** Secure, publicly verifiable random number generation for GameFi, NFT, and DeFi applications.
- **Resilient and Transparent Infrastructure:** Open-source and auditable data solutions, ensuring trust and security in decentralized applications.

### Using DIA Oracles on Alephium

Alephium developers can now integrate DIA’s **price oracles and VRF solutions** to power lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, synthetic assets, GameFi mechanics, and more.
