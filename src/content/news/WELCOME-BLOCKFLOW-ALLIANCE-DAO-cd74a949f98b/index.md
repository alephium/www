Daily, we strive to enhance our decentralized infrastructure, inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision for a permissionless future. We offer developers advanced tools, precise documentation, and direct access to our core team on Discord. Our commitment to user-friendly front-end tools reflects our investment in top-tier UI and UX.

But today, it’s about the community. And the community is going one step further, stronger, faster!

#### **Welcome Blockflow Alliance DAO!**

The first community-run DAO has been announced yesterday, and has given itself the following objectives:

> Expanding the Community: \[…\]  
> Nurturing Development: \[…\]_

It is being built around well-known and highly respected community members, <a href="https://twitter.com/cg1_bin" data-href="https://twitter.com/cg1_bin">cgi-bin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Oheka32" data-href="https://twitter.com/Oheka32">Oheka</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/diomark" data-href="https://twitter.com/diomark">Diomark</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanRit91769208" data-href="https://twitter.com/RyanRit91769208">Ryannn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/headroomcapital" data-href="https://twitter.com/headroomcapital">hEAdroom</a> & <a href="https://twitter.com/zkitbeats" data-href="https://twitter.com/zkitbeats">Waldi</a>.

It will require the community’s creativity and efforts!

The Blockflow Alliance DAO has applied for a grant with Alephium, via the grants & rewards program for \$ALPH out of the ecosystem funds. This request is being reviewed as we speak, and after careful consideration and the usual process, a decision will be made and announced.

This first DAO is a pioneer toward a future with multiple DAOs focused on different aspects of the expansion of the Alephium Universe!
