#### We’re happy to announce that the Alephium token ticker symbol is officially **ALPH.**

As we are starting discussion with venues for the public sale, it was important for the project to choose its official token ticker symbol.

Following a vote within the team and the community, we have chosen the ticker symbol of ALPH for the Alephium token. We’re optimistically excited to see Alephium and the ALPH token reach more and more people in the months to come.

#### Why Alephium anyways? And what is א?

For those of you less familiar with set theory and mathematics the origin of the name “Alephium” might not be so evident. It is made from the name “Aleph” which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number" rel="noopener" target="_blank">defined on wikipedia</a>: _“Aleph numbers are a sequence of numbers used to represent the cardinality of infinite sets that can be well-ordered. They were introduced by the mathematician Georg Cantor and are named after the symbol he used to denote them, the Hebrew letter_ **_aleph (_ ℵ \*)\*\***”\*

In fact, the logotype for Alephium is a stylisation of the letter Aleph. Furthermore, we use the letter “_ℵ”_ to denote ALPH in short form to display values, as you may witness in the Testnet Explorer available to the public here: <a href="https://testnet.alephium.org" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://testnet.alephium.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://testnet.alephium.org</a>.

In an homage to the technical promises of Ethereum, we followed the same naming pattern and the name **Alephium** was coined.
