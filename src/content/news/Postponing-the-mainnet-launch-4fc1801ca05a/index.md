title: Postponing the mainnet launch

#### Launching a mainnet is no small task for a small team; in addition to the many technical challenges it poses, there are a lot of non-technical topics to be addressed.

In Alephium’s case, one critical task is gathering all the public addresses of the numerous pre-sale participants. It is necessary as these will be part of the genesis block and allow for the pre-sale participants to receive their allocated tokens over a period of time.

Unfortunately, despite everyone’s best effort it became apparent that it won’t be possible to gather and verify those public wallet-addresses in time to prepare the genesis block for the end of September.

As a result, we have decided to **postpone the mainnet launch to October**.

The realization that having a little extra-time would be beneficial to the entire project has been overwhelmingly welcomed internally. This will not only allow a smoother start on a human level, it would give the opportunity to push a few improvements to the full node and test them thoroughly.

We know many of you are impatiently waiting for the mainnet to get up and running and we are sorry to have you waiting a little more. But we are confident that this period of extra time will tighten the solidity and overall stability that you have come to expect from <a href="https://github.com/alephium" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://github.com/alephium" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alephium.</a>
