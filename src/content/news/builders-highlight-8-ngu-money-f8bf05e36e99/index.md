This episode is about ngu.money, an Alephium-native platform featuring the \$NGU token while offering advanced trading tools and a soon-to-be Launchpad as a Service (LaaS). Here, they share some insights into their way of thinking & plans for the future!

## **What is NGU Money? Where did it come from? How did it come to¬†be?**

NGU Money is an innovative cryptocurrency platform, defined by its deflationary token, \$NGU, residing on the Alephium blockchain. NGU Money stands out for its community-driven approach and commitment to transparency and efficiency and is designed to provide advanced trading tools and launchpad services (Launchpad as a Service‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLaaS). Launched on the AYIN decentralised exchange on December 8, 2023, NGU Money was born from the ambition to create an engaging and enriching ecosystem for the cryptocurrency community.

## **Can you explain a bit about the multiple facets of that¬†project?**

NGU Money encompasses several key components:

**1. NGU Signals:** A powerhouse in crypto trading with an 80%+ win rate on 200 coins, offering alerts for making informed decisions: [https://app.ngu.money/subscribe](https://app.ngu.money/subscribe)

**2. Utility:** Beyond its origin as a meme coin, NGU is introducing Trade Battle Utility, adding a competitive dimension to the trading experience.

**3. NFT Collection:** The Alpha Bulls NFT Collection, achieving rapid success and high rankings on DEADRARE.io, showcases NGU‚Äôs strong footing in the NFT space: [https://deadrare.io/collection/alpha-bulls](https://deadrare.io/collection/alpha-bulls)

**4. NGU Tip Wallet:** An on-chain Alephium wallet facilitates secure and easy tipping within the NGU community via Discord, enhancing the project‚Äôs community engagement.

## **NGU has, to say the least, strong branding! When it comes to branding, what is NGU‚Äôs target audience? Who does it want to¬†attract?**

With its vibrant branding, NGU aims to attract a broad spectrum of users, from seasoned traders to crypto newcomers. The project taps into the rich meme culture of cryptocurrency, producing content that engages and fosters a sense of belonging among its community.

## **When did you go from a community/idea to the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs build something‚Äù meta? What motivated you to build on Alephium?**

The transition from concept to creation was fuelled by the desire to offer unique and effective trading tools within a community-centric ecosystem. The choice of Alephium as the foundation was due to its technical advantages in security and efficiency, making it the ideal platform to support the project‚Äôs growth and the development of its community.

## **What upcoming features on your project are you the most excited¬†about?**

We are particularly excited about the development of NGU.land, introducing nguSquares as an innovative advertising module to enhance token visibility. Alongside this, the launch and promotion of the NGU LOVE token and the creation of the NGU Love Pool are key initiatives we‚Äôre looking forward to, as they embody our ethos of community engagement and support.

## **How do you engage with the Alephium community, and how has this community influenced your project development?**

We engage with the Alephium community through collaborative projects, events, and feedback channels. This partnership has been instrumental in shaping the direction and development of NGU Money, ensuring that we remain aligned with community needs and blockchain innovation.

## **Which projects or dApps built on Alephium & part of that ecosystem, are you most intrigued/excited about?**

The team is intrigued by projects like ayin.app, which has facilitated \$NGU trading, and Deadrare, an NFT marketplace where NGU listed its first NFT collection, ‚Äú[Alphabulls](https://deadrare.io/collection/alpha-bulls),‚Äù achieving instant success.

## **What‚Äôs your view on the ecosystem growth and evolution of the past few months? What are you looking forward to the most in Alephium?**

The growth and evolution of the Alephium ecosystem have been remarkable, with significant advancements in decentralized applications, speed of the blockchain, and community engagement. We are most excited about the future innovations that will continue to enrich the ecosystem, offering new opportunities for NGU Money and its community. The Alph hackathon was an ingenious idea by the Alephium team and an innovative way to inspire further growth and development in the ecosystem.
