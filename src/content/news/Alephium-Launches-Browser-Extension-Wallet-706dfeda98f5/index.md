Alephium launched its browser extension wallet, designed to provide a secure and convenient way for users to manage their digital assets and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Alephium network.

This wallet was based on the <a href="https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-x" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-x" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Argent X</a> wallet, with changes and improvements to make it suitable for the Alephium blockchain. It is **fully compatible with the current mainnet** and includes features that will be available after the Leman Network Upgrade, like Schnorr signatures, addresses book, token lists, etc. These new features can already be tried on Alephium‚Äôs testnet and are explained in more detail below.

### Main Features

#### Token Faucet

Another feature of the Alephium browser extension wallet is its **token faucet** support (a feature enabled on Alephium‚Äôs Devnet and Testnet only). This allows users to obtain small amounts of Alephium tokens for testing purposes easily. You just need to click on the ‚Äúadd funds‚Äù button and then on the ‚Äúrequest \$ALPH‚Äù to receive the tokens.

#### Address Book

The Alephium browser extension wallet has an **address book** feature for users who repeatedly send transactions to the same addresses. This allows users to save frequently used addresses, helps to avoid typos, and makes it quick and easy to send transactions to the same recipient multiple times.

#### Schnorr Signatures

Finally, the wallet features **Schnorr Signatures**. This is a more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature" rel="noopener" target="_blank">advanced signature algorithm</a> designed to be faster and more efficient than the traditional ECDSA signature algorithm. Schnorr signatures allow users to securely sign messages and verify their authenticity, ensuring their transactions are always secure and tamper-proof. It also provides faster transaction processing times and lower transaction fees.¬†  
This feature enables <a href="https://nostr.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://nostr.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nostr</a> support, making the wallet capable of signing messages in the social network. It could also be leveraged in other Schnorr-based applications.
