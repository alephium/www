#### Thanks to [Flux](https://runonflux.io/), it is easier than ever to run an Alephium full node. But it could become even easier. All it takes is a little distribution of knowledge!

Help decentralize the skills required to run a full-node and enter our Tutorial contest: **Produce the best tutorial on how to run an Alephium full node on FLUX and win prizes!**

### üè´ The¬†Tutorial

#### How?

You chose the format: A blog post, a Twitter thread, or a video. Your imagination is the limit.
