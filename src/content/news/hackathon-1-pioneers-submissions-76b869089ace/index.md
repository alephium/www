title: 'Hackathon #1- Pioneers — Submissions'
---

_After two weeks of intense coding, debugging, building & good vibes, teams or individuals have submitted their projects. While the jury is judging & because it doesn’t stop with the end of the hackathon, here’s a recap of all projects, with all the information & links to follow them as they keep evolving over the next few weeks & months!_

From Alephium’s core-contributor’s perspective, it’s been an incredible experience to imagine & organize that hackathon. But the event itself has been nothing short of absolutely fantastic.

We’ve felt our partners' warm and unwavering support, and we thank them for this. Bitmain, the Blockflow Alliance DAO, Cetacean Capital & Dappnode have contributed significantly to the pool prize.

The energy on all our channels has been intense & has electrified all of us, the builders and the ecosystem!

The Hackathon \#1 — Pioneers was a 14-day sprint during which developers gathered to hack and build on Alephium. They were allowed to apply across 3 main tracks or 2 types of bounties: existing or self-defined. More than 105 individuals applied from 21+ countries and divided themselves into 26 projects who valably submitted.

#### Merkle tree proof for allowlist — Bounties

![](image_4916b35eda.jpg)

Merkle trees are essential in blockchain and dApp development, they facilitate implementations where the entire set of data can’t be stored on chain and a solution is needed to verify a set of data exists and is valid without having the entire dataset for verification purpose.

The implementation is inspired by [OpenZeppelin ETH](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol) library, in an attempt to provide a standardized reliable implementation of merkle proofs on Alephium

### Next steps

The hackathon has been a humbling and exciting experience. Many of the builders are actually using what they built during those two weeks to produce more polished products. The jury is now reviewing every submission (as are the partners) and will soon announce the winners.

That was just the first hackathon in the Alephium Ecosystem. More will follow. In the meantime, if you’re building something and need a grant, access the [Alephium Community Grants &amp; Reward Program page](https://github.com/alephium/community/blob/master/Grant%26RewardProgram.md)!

If you are an aspiring builder, start [here](https://twitter.com/alephium/status/1752028946399654269)! If you have questions, ping us on [Discord](/discord) in any of the devs channels. You can also reach us on [Telegram](https://t.me/alephiumgroup) & follow [@alephium on Twitter](https://twitter.com/alephium) to stay up-to-date.
