**Op-ed by Ratko, Marketing Lead, Alephium.**

Hello and welcome! This is the first column article from Ratko, our Marketing Lead. Many of our community know him best as the Quartermaster of the Alephium Guard, our ambassador program. Today, he explores some of the unique realities of the cryptocurrency industry.

**Note**: The views and opinions expressed in this column are those of the author and may not reflect the official stance of Alephium.

*My father was a revolutionary, and I wanted to be one too.*

In 2014, crypto didn’t look like an industry, it looked like a movement. It looked like a promise that code could fix what politics couldn’t. So, I grabbed the first opportunity I had and started preaching about Bitcoin, blockchain, and what this new kind of financial system could mean for ordinary people. I liked it. I liked the people, the ideas, and it felt good to be part of something that was trying to make the world a fairer place.

But then, a few years later, came the race for speed, gains, features; everything new and shiny. We got lost along the way. We moved forward so fast that we forgot why we had started in the first place.

## **When Progress Lost Its Ground**

I mean, it’s easy to forget when the future looks so bright. Every revolutionary was also a potential millionaire. And, is there anything sweeter than making money while changing the world? Being Jesus while living like Bezos. 

We built DeFi machines powered by staking, then staked the staking, then borrowed against it. Rinse and repeat twenty times, until it takes you six months to detangle the entire web of yields. Entire ecosystems were built on promises, billions raised and pumped into cotton clouds. 

The industry became a hall of mirrors: yield chasing yield, liquidity chasing liquidity. Everything looked like a million bucks, literally. 

The hordes of projects came and the space became flooded with noise. Many came to the promised land, and nearly every founder dreamed of becoming the new Trump, McAfee, or Andrew Tate, commanding his army of subjects. Satoshi, that poor bastard, became history, long forgotten, if he even existed. Knowing our industry, I’m sure he would suffer the destiny of Caesar as soon as he showed his face. 

But, back to the bright side. In those times, marketing experts became revered as shamans. Everyone had a “marketing first” approach. We could finally get developers to do something for us, after years of pushing marketing needs to the backlog. 

*Being a marketeer became the best thing in the world.*

## **The Illusion of Marketing**

For a while, anyway. The thing is, in the bull market, marketing looks easy. Every post trends. Every chart goes up. Every partnership, no matter how small, is easily sold as momentum.

You could launch a meme coin, call it a movement, and people would believe you. Money grows on trees, and everyone wants to grab as much as possible as fast as possible.

Crypto marketing became an arms race for attention - KOLs, influencers, celebrities, even pornstars selling exposure instead of understanding. The focus shifted from building trust to buying it. A hyper-competitive pond full of crocodiles, where the one with the deepest pockets wins. A theater.

But, when the market turns, the illusions break. Celsius, Terra, FTX - every collapse was a reminder that the foundation had rotted away long before the roof caved in.

The theater stopped working. The community's obsession with visibility became a rock every marketer has to push uphill until the next bull run. 

*“Why aren’t we listed there?”* 

*“Why don’t we have huge banners or celebrity endorsements?”*

*“Why not sponsor a massive hackathon?”* 

*“Wen Binance Alpha?”* 

*“Kaito AI!”*

And then, in all that chaos, while many are trying to sell the unsellable, you see it. Real marketing isn’t about noise, it’s about alignment between what you say and what you build. If the message grows faster than the product, the image collapses under its own weight.

That’s what happened to much of Web3. Too much smoke and mirrors, not enough substance. 

## **Return of the Lost Children**

*In these cycles of life, we see what’s up.* 

After every bull run, the silence returns. In that silence, the real builders come to light. The ones who remember why they started. The ones who never stopped believing that this space was supposed to be about more than speculation.

**Alephium** was born from that kind of conviction, a belief that progress doesn’t come from abandoning the old principles, but from perfecting them.

In **technology**, we improved PoW, made it scalable and efficient.

In **economics**, we are building a system that rewards contributions, not speculation. To generate real value and align all network participants.

In **marketing**, we are focusing on credibility over noise, telling stories that match reality. And sometimes, when there is a lot of noise, what we offer may not seem glamorous. But it’s real. And real is what endures. 

Our story may not always be the loudest, but it will be the one that lasts, because it’s written in **code**, **community**, and **conviction**. So, don’t worry if you don’t see a thousand headlines about us.

Because you’ll see us here tomorrow. And the day after. And the one after that.

That’s not just **proof of work**. That’s **proof of conviction**.
