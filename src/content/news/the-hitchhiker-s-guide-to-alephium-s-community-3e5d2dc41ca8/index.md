_We are thrilled to see many new faces in our community! Alephium community channels have recently grown tremendously, and we thought it might be a good time to write a little community guide to ensure everyone knows where to find the informations they need & navigate our various channels._

### Discord

Alephiumâ€™s Discord is the comprehensive community hub with channels for everyone from developers, miners, traders, regular lounge discussion and various language groups. [Alephiumâ€™s Discord](/discord) is the main forum for you to engage with the community!

### TelegramÂ channels

Our global Telegram group makes it easy to stay updated or enjoying casual conversations! We have terrific community mods in there, and they are crazy helpful for newcomers & tech-savvy users alike.

The main channel is [Alephium Group](https://t.me/alephiumgroup), itâ€™s the official English channel.

If you prefer only receiving our updates without the community discussion side of things, you can just subscribe to the [Alephium Announcements Channel](https://t.me/Alephium_Announcement)\*\*Â \*\*, it will allow you to stay up to date.

There are numerous Community channels too! These are run by the community (not by us), but they might be of interest to some of you!

[Alephium Trading channel](https://t.me/alephium_trading)â€Šâ€”â€Šwhere you can discuss everything (almost) trading-related!

[Alephiumâ€Šâ€”â€ŠMining](https://t.me/alephium_mining)â€Šâ€”â€ŠGet help setting up your mining rig and all things mining!

There are 2 bots developed by members of the community:

[Whales alert](https://t.me/alphwhalesalert) shows you big transactions moves.

[Insights](https://t.me/alephiumin) gives you regular updates on hashrate, circulating supply & mining rewards.

**Then** there are localized groups (these are non-official groups, created and modded by independant third-parties Alephium has no control on)
