_If you couldn’t come… Doesn’t mean you can’t see the presentations! Find them all here and watch them at your convenience._

Alephium’s first builders meetup was held in Athens June 21–23 2024. It has been an incredible gathering where the builders of ecosystem’s projects were able to meet & mingle with core contributors in an insightful, joyous & studious atmosphere.

### **Who Attended?**

In total, more than 60 participants turned up! Some came from as far as Vancouver, Michigan, Argentina or Canada to Athens for a 2 day summit! We are absolutely humbled & elated by this level of effort and dedication.

Most of the attendees were builders of a lot of the ecosystem’s biggest projects: <a href="https://x.com/ayincoin" >Ayin</a>, <a href="https://x.com/PyreplayDotCom" >Pyreplay</a>/<a href="https://x.com/fugashu_codes" >Alph.land</a>, <a href="https://x.com/ulamlabs" >Ulam</a>, <a href="https://x.com/invariant_labs" >Invariant</a>, <a href="https://x.com/linx_labs" >Linx</a>, <a href="https://x.com/SesameWallet" >Sezame</a>, <a href="https://x.com/alephiumbank" >Alphbanx</a>, <a href="https://x.com/DeadRareNFT" >Deadrare</a>, <a href="https://mobula.io/chain/alephium" >Mobula</a>, <a href="https://x.com/notrustverif" >NTV</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Alphdotpro" >AlphPro</a>, <a href="https://x.com/AlphagaMarket" >Alphaga</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GoldCastleClub" >GoldcastleClub</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Shin_Inu_Aleph" >Shin</a>, <a href="https://x.com/AlephiumBattle" >Alephium Battle</a>, <a href="https://x.com/PhoenixErgo" >HodlAlph</a> & <a href="https://x.com/gigacheng" >GigaCheng</a> were all represented there.

11 of the core contributors were there & gave presentations on very diverse topics and made sure things ran as smoothly as possible! Some well-known community moderators & friends from <a href="https://x.com/bity" >Bity</a>, <a href="https://x.com/nymproject" >Nym</a>, & <a href="https://x.com/ergo_platform" >Ergo</a> also showed up.

Some of our sponsors who made the meetup possible were able to attend. We were lucky enough to have <a href="https://x.com/Hearst_io" >Hearst</a>, <a href="https://x.com/AntPoolofficial" >Antpool</a> & <a href="http://hodling.ch/" >Hodling</a> with us. <a href="https://banxa.com/" >Banxa</a> we missed you there! The <a href="https://x.com/Blockflow_DAO" >Blockflow DAO</a> was well represented with 3 of its members there. It has greatly supported that meetup with its travel grant helped many of the builders to attend who wouldn’t have been able to otherwise.

### **Show me the meetup!**

In general, the aim of the meetup was to provide a time for cross-pollinating ideas, meeting long-known discord usernames IRL & learn from each other. The following presentations follow the schedule of the meetup (if you want more details on the schedule, find it <a href="/news/post/full-builders-meetup-program-announced-cda1af0e1355" >here</a>.).

We’ve worked hard at making them accessible in a simple way. If you can’t hear well enough, you can activate the subtitles. If for some reason you can’t read well enough on the presentations, we have included them as a link so you can download them:
