_If you couldn’t come… Doesn’t mean you can’t see the presentations! Find them all here and watch them at your convenience._

Alephium’s first builders meetup was held in Athens June 21–23 2024. It has been an incredible gathering where the builders of ecosystem’s projects were able to meet & mingle with core contributors in an insightful, joyous & studious atmosphere.

### **Who Attended?**

In total, more than 60 participants turned up! Some came from as far as Vancouver, Michigan, Argentina or Canada to Athens for a 2 day summit! We are absolutely humbled & elated by this level of effort and dedication.

Most of the attendees were builders of a lot of the ecosystem’s biggest projects: [Ayin](https://x.com/ayincoin), [Pyreplay](https://x.com/PyreplayDotCom)/[Alph.land](https://x.com/fugashu_codes), [Ulam](https://x.com/ulamlabs), [Invariant](https://x.com/invariant_labs), [Linx](https://x.com/linx_labs), [Sezame](https://x.com/SesameWallet), [Alphbanx](https://x.com/alephiumbank), [Deadrare](https://x.com/DeadRareNFT), [Mobula](https://mobula.io/chain/alephium), [NTV](https://x.com/notrustverif), [AlphPro](https://x.com/Alphdotpro), [Alphaga](https://x.com/AlphagaMarket), [GoldcastleClub](https://x.com/GoldCastleClub), [Shin](https://x.com/Shin_Inu_Aleph), [Alephium Battle](https://x.com/AlephiumBattle), [HodlAlph](https://x.com/PhoenixErgo) & [GigaCheng](https://x.com/gigacheng) were all represented there.

11 of the core contributors were there & gave presentations on very diverse topics and made sure things ran as smoothly as possible! Some well-known community moderators & friends from [Bity](https://x.com/bity), [Nym](https://x.com/nymproject), & [Ergo](https://x.com/ergo_platform) also showed up.

Some of our sponsors who made the meetup possible were able to attend. We were lucky enough to have [Hearst](https://x.com/Hearst_io), [Antpool](https://x.com/AntPoolofficial) & [Hodling](http://hodling.ch/) with us. [Banxa](https://banxa.com/) we missed you there! The [Blockflow DAO](https://x.com/Blockflow_DAO) was well represented with 3 of its members there. It has greatly supported that meetup with its travel grant helped many of the builders to attend who wouldn’t have been able to otherwise.

### **Show me the meetup!**

In general, the aim of the meetup was to provide a time for cross-pollinating ideas, meeting long-known discord usernames IRL & learn from each other. The following presentations follow the schedule of the meetup (if you want more details on the schedule, find it [here](/news/post/full-builders-meetup-program-announced-cda1af0e1355).).

We’ve worked hard at making them accessible in a simple way. If you can’t hear well enough, you can activate the subtitles. If for some reason you can’t read well enough on the presentations, we have included them as a link so you can download them:
