Propose a design for the Alephium Toolkit website and win 1500 \$ALPH!

The core team released the Multisig Wallet Creation tool last week, the first in the [Alephium Toolkit](https://alephium.github.io/alephium-toolkit/)! [Here](/news/post/alephium-multisig-gui-is-here-4b23bec7e2f), you’ll find a detailed tutorial on how to use it. The toolkit is a simple web app with handy tools for wallets, tokens, and NFTs. It’s still in the early stage of development, but the long-term goals are to provide:

- Convenient tools for developers to inspect their dApps;
- Advanced tools for advanced use cases, e.g. multisig; and
- A reference implementation for the common tasks working with token, NFT, and wallet.

Whip your creativity, use your design skills & leverage that bear-market energy to produce the best toolkit logo!
