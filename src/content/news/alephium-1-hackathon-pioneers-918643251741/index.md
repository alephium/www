- 3 — improve the [Ralph language doc](https://docs.alephium.org/ralph/getting-started)

**Coding PoC**

Creating proof-of-concepts / code examples that help to explain Alephium. (Create a PR in [this repo](https://github.com/alephium/ralph-example))

- 4 — Merkle tree proof for allowlist
- 5 — Crowdfund platform
- 6 — Simple price Oracle
- 7 — Simple DAO
- 8 — Airdrop contract

**Front-End Task**

- 11 — [Any pending issue](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-frontend/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acommunity) marked with the community tag.

**Community Dashboards & Calculators**

Designing a dashboard & calculators for useful information.

- 12 — Dune analytics board for the wALPH Uniswap ppol
- 13 — ETH wALPH stats
- 14 — dApps stats dashboard
- 15 — Mining reward calculator
- 16 — Burned tokens calculator

**Your own idea**

If you have an idea for a bounty, propose it to us in the general chat of the hackathon!

_For submission, the process is the same as for main quests. Once you have chosen a bounty, please create a post in the Hackathon-Projects channel with the name of the bounty as a title. You can document your progress there or ask us for help or advice in the post. At the end of the hackathon, you will provide a link to your work in the submission form, to be evaluated by the jury!_
