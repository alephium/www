Alephium was built for real-world finance as a secure, scalable, and powerful infrastructure for the next wave of decentralized applications. But one thing was missing: institutional-grade custody.

That’s why we’re excited to announce our partnership with PrimeVault, a next-gen institutional custody and DeFi platform. Together, we’re bringing secure, compliant access to Alephium’s DeFi ecosystem, backed by powerful automation, custody, and liquidity tools trusted by financial institutions worldwide.

## Why This Partnership Matters

For institutional players, security, compliance, and seamless infrastructure are non-negotiable. PrimeVault delivers exactly that through MPC custody, programmable vaults, and automated workflows.

With PrimeVault integrated into Alephium, institutions can now access:

- **On-chain custody and compliance frameworks**, supporting programmable settlement, KYC layers, and institutional access controls.

- **Structured DeFi strategies**, including automated yield products, lending markets, and risk-managed vaults.

- **Decentralized trading and liquidity provision**, with high-throughput performance and finality guarantees.

- **Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs)**, enabling exposure to off-chain financial products within programmable, permissionless environments.

- And more.

This unlocks a whole new segment of capital and users for the Alephium ecosystem without compromising on decentralization or performance.

*“Alephium is a high-performance execution layer purpose-built for real-world applications, scalable, energy-efficient, and designed with UX and security at its core. Our integration with PrimeVault brings the institutional-grade infrastructure needed to unlock serious capital deployment into Alephium DeFi, support native custody, and enable tokenization of real-world assets directly on-chain”,* **said Cheng Wang, Founder of Alephium.**

## Already Powering Real Use Cases

This isn’t just theoretical. We’re already seeing institutional teams use this infrastructure:

- **WeMine**, a new mining dApp built on Alephium, is working with PrimeVault to custody mined ALPH and access both CeFi and DeFi rails.

- **Market makers** in our ecosystem are using PrimeVault’s MPC stack to securely provision liquidity across CEXs and DEXs, boosting capital efficiency while maintaining top-tier security.

*“For WeMine, PrimeVault’s integration into Alephium has been a game-changer. It gives us a secure and compliant framework to store mined ALPH while tapping into on-chain DeFi rails with confidence. We see this as a foundational layer for scaling decentralized mining investments to institutional standards”,* **said Maxime Slemett, CPO of WeMine**

This is just the beginning. Expect more integrations, deeper tooling, and a growing set of real institutional users interacting natively with Alephium.

## $200K Grant Program to Boost Institutional-Ready Builders

To accelerate ecosystem growth, PrimeVault is launching a **$200,000 grant fund** in credits for teams building on Alephium.

The focus? Real-world financial apps. Builders of automated strategies, tokenized RWA infrastructure, lending protocols, and regulated liquidity tooling will be prioritized.

Grant recipients get more than just funding, they’ll gain:

- Priority access to PrimeVault’s infrastructure and API
- Support from their engineering team
- Direct connectivity to regulated liquidity partners

This is a huge opportunity for teams looking to build production-grade, institution-ready products on Alephium. This grant program shows PrimeVault’s long-term commitment to supporting Alephium and teams building serious, production-grade on-chain finance.

## The Infrastructure Behind the Integration

To make this work, our core devs worked closely with PrimeVault’s security architects to ensure the infrastructure meets the most demanding institutional requirements without compromising Alephium’s core design principles.

Here’s what powers it:

**From PrimeVault:**

- MPC custody with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
- Formal verification and programmable policy controls
- Seamless integrations with both CeFi and DeFi venues
- A simple, fast UI that institutions like

**From Alephium:**

- Native sharding and PoW architecture with 8-second blocks
- 20,000 TPS throughput and horizontal scalability
- Security-first smart contracts with sUTXO architecture
- UX that feels like Web 2

*“Alephium has built one of the most technically advanced Layer-1s on the market, and institutional demand for access is accelerating. Bitcoin, while the largest and most secure digital asset, has traditionally been limited in programmability. Alephium bridges that gap, combining Bitcoin’s core principles with a high-performance architecture for smart contracts and a modern UX layer as a first-class primitive. We’re excited to enable institutional access to this next evolution with the security and efficiency they expect”,* **said Akansh Jain, Co-founder and CBO of PrimeVault.**

## Built for What’s Next

With PrimeVault, Alephium now has the infrastructure to support hedge funds, market makers, custodians, and institutions building real financial products on a secure, scalable Proof-of-Work L1.

We’re not just chasing TVL. We’re building the foundations for serious capital, long-term trust, and sustainable growth.

If you’re building for institutions — or *are* one — this is your moment.
