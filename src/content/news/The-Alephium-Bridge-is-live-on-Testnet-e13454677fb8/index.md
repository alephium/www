#### Bridge assets from and to Ethereum Goerli Testnet and BNB Smart Chain Testnet

A key to the future of Alephium is the ability to move tokens cross-chain, and since before the Leman Upgrade was ready, a lot of work has gone on working on the first bridge to another chain.

Today is a big step in that direction: **The Alephium Bridge is live on Testnet**.

This means transferring test tokens from Alephium’s testnet to Ethereum’s and BSC's testnet and back is possible!

You can interact with the testnet bridge using the following addresses:

Connect to the bridge via the portal URL: <a href="https://testnet.bridge.alephium.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://testnet.bridge.alephium.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://testnet.bridge.alephium.org/</a>

Bridge explorer: <a href="https://explorer.wormhole-testnet.alephium.org/explorer/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://explorer.wormhole-testnet.alephium.org/explorer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://explorer.wormhole-testnet.alephium.org/explorer/</a>

In this article, you will find all you need to successfully bridge two ways from Alephium testnet to Ethereum’s Goerli and BSC’s Testnet!

This includes the following steps:

> What do you need to know beforehand to connect to the bridge?

> How to connect to the Bridge?

> How to connect to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet?

> How to bridge an asset from Alephium to Goerli?

> How to bridge an asset from Goerli to Alephium?

> How to connect to the BSC Testnet?

> How to bridge an asset from Alephium to BSC Testnet?

> How to bridge an asset from BSC Testnet to Alephium?

Let’s get started!

### 1 — What you need to know before connecting to the bridge

<figure id="95fa" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3">
<img src="image_1cba43d838.png" class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ZObINXgYH-n36EiZxE4aGQ.png" data-width="2878" data-height="1190" />
<figcaption>Get ready for a transformative experience</figcaption>
</figure>

_🚨 It is not yet possible to use the bridge on the mainnet   
🚨 Before starting, make sure you are connected to Alephium’s testnet!  
🚨 You need an address in Group 0 (on Alephium testnet). And test \$ALPH tokens_

**How to create an address in Group 0?**

- Open the Browser Extension Wallet:
- Click on the current address name, and then in the “+” icon.

![](image_3b9bc32da5.png)

- Click on the Group selector and choose Group 0. Now you have a new address in Group 0!

**How to request test \$ALPH tokens?**

Don’t have \$ALPH in your wallet?

You can ask for some right from the wallet!

- Click “Add funds” on the main page and then “Request \$ALPH.” You will receive 12 Testnet \$ALPH in a few minutes.

![](image_4827281ff4.png)

### 2 — How to connect to the bridge?

<figure id="c047" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3">
<img src="image_8b1cb8874d.png" class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*JvEpK8zI9Ocpr27_IktV4g.png" data-width="2880" data-height="1186" />
<figcaption>Hop on the wagon and let’s go!</figcaption>
</figure>

To connect to the bridge, go to <a href="https://portal-bridge.wormhole-testnet.alephium.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://portal-bridge.wormhole-testnet.alephium.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://portal-bridge.wormhole-testnet.alephium.org</a>

![](image_cb924097f9.png)

Once on the page, click on the “connect” button. A prompt will appear, and you can choose which wallet you want to use to connect to the bridge.

![](image_2d2e9c8e57.png)

You can use the <a href="https://medium.com/@alephium/alephium-launches-browser-extension-wallet-706dfeda98f5" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@alephium/alephium-launches-browser-extension-wallet-706dfeda98f5" target="_blank">Extension Wallet</a> or the <a href="https://medium.com/@alephium/the-desktop-wallet-2-0-d818bc1c722b" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@alephium/the-desktop-wallet-2-0-d818bc1c722b" target="_blank">Desktop Wallet</a>. (the WalletConnect option is currently not supported).

After choosing your connection method, you can see your address below the two chains form.

![](image_822af4f84e.png)

The token bridge helps to send a token from one network to another. Now that you’re connected on Alephium’s side, it is time to connect to the other side: The first destination, the Goerli Ethereum testnet.

### 3 — How to connect to the Goerli Ethereum testnet?

<figure id="2747" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3">
<img src="image_5d5d1ccad8.png" class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ZCbruOp6T_n49kcJMCzWIQ.png" data-width="2870" data-height="1182" />
<figcaption>Goerli workers fixing transactions</figcaption>
</figure>

To connect to the Goerli Ethereum testnet, you will need a wallet. In this example, we’ll use <a href="https://metamask.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://metamask.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Metamask</a> but it would work similarly with other wallets.

🚨 _If using Metamask, before starting the process, go to the “advanced settings”, and make sure that the “show test networks” toggle is activated!_

![](image_dbfc00a73e.png)

If you’re on a different chain, you must change to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet.

![](image_577ec9c5f0.png)

Click the “Ethereum Mainnet” button and select the “Goerli Testnet” as the network.

![](image_a06fea8708.png)

You will see that the network name has changed to “Goerli test network.”

![](image_46dc0159f5.png)

You will need enough GoerliETH to pay the fast fee for your incoming transaction on the Goerli Testnet (and send it to the Alephium Testnet).

You can get 0.2 GoerliETH/day (It requires a subscription) here: <a href="https://goerlifaucet.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://goerlifaucet.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://goerlifaucet.com/</a>

<a href="https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/goerli" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/goerli" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/goerli</a> is another option (no subscription), but not as reliable and fast as the previous one. It provides 0.005 GoerliETH/day.

After receiving the ETH Goerli tokens, your Metamask wallet will be able to pay the transaction fee for the bridge of the target chain.

The page will show the address you are connected to on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet and the current balance of Alephium (Wormhole) on it. This is the bridged \$ALPH in the Goerli Ethereum Testnet

Once you’re ready, click on “Transfer.”

![](image_be413f5eed.png)

A pop-up will request your confirmation.

![](image_1d1c05b46d.png)

Your wallet will show the transaction for review. If everything is fine, click on “Sign.”

![](image_d5cbe236ea.png)

The transaction will take a fair amount of time (at least a few minutes! Please be patient)

![](image_10cea4145e.png)

After you get the confirmation that the transaction has been completed, you can redeem your ALPH on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet. To do so, click on the “Redeem” button.

![](image_f0fbeebff1.png)

Your Goerli ETH wallet will then show the transaction for your review. Check if everything is fine and click on “Confirm.”

![](image_c0fa5f2bee.png)

When the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, the bridge will show the transaction details:

![](image_9ee0da72ce.png)

To be able to see your tokens in Metamask, you’ll need to import them. Here are the steps:

Click on “Assets”:

![](image_764099e091.png)

Click on “Import Tokens”.

![](image_0d02448477.png)

On this page, add the following information:

> Token Symbol: ALPH  
> Token Decimal: 18

Now you can see your \$ALPH in your Wallet.

![](image_9bc9928c5e.png)

**Using the “Redeem” section of the bridge**.

If, for some reason, you left the bridge page before redeeming your tokens, you can always get your transaction hash from <a href="https://explorer.testnet.alephium.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://explorer.testnet.alephium.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://explorer.testnet.alephium.org/</a>, and then click “Redeem” on the bridge page, paste it into the “source TX” field, and click “Recover.”

![](image_48e18dc248.png)

Your Goerli ETH wallet will then show the transaction for our review. Check if everything is fine and click on “Confirm.”

It can take up to 15 minutes to finalize the transaction.

![](image_0ed8c468e0.png)

After the confirmation, you can redeem the ETH to your Alephium wallet. Click on the “redeem” button.

![](image_258a739e40.png)

Your Alephium Wallet will show you a transaction to sign. Review and information and click “sign.” (If you don’t see the ETH in your wallet, complete the next step).

![](image_2ec097e1ef.png)

You can verify the transaction on <a href="https://explorer.testnet.alephium.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://explorer.testnet.alephium.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://explorer.testnet.alephium.org/</a>

**How to add ETH to your Browser Extension Wallet**

If you bridged ETH to Alephium, you would need to add the token information to your wallet. To do that, click on “New Token”

![](image_c7a2b8f627.png)

This will show a new page to add the information about the token.

![](image_3869e38234.png)
