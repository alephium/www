#### Interviews of the humans behind Alephium.

For its team, Alephium is privileging agility and efficiency over hyper-growth. We do not stay at a human size because we think it is more efficient, but because Alephium strives to be a decentralised, community driven project. This means the project in itself is much larger than a team can ever be. Communication, trust, openness and transparency is paramount in such a set-up.

In fact, we haven’t communicated much about ourselves so far because we think _who we are_ is less relevant than _what we deliver_. To nevertheless shed some light on who we are and what we do, we decided to share a little about ourselves with the community through a small series of interviews.

_This is an updated version of the previously released articles available here:\***\*

Now I’m more into music: guitar/alphorn/singing.

#### How/when did you come across crypto?

I heard a lot about it, but really went into it when joining Alephium :)

> I already worked with Cheng and the rest of the team, I knew I would love to work with them again, so I dived more into the project.

#### How did you come across Alephium and what attracted you to the project?

I already worked with Cheng and the rest of the team, I knew I would love to work with them again, so I dived more into the project. I didn’t know much about crypto back then, but this all sharded-decentralized network technology looked awesome to build. I think I discovered a bit later the potential of Alephium compared to the other blockchains.

#### What are you doing at Alephium? What is your title (if you have one, what would it be, if you don’t)? What are you good at?

I’m a core developer, as I joined quite early the project I had the opportunity to work on almost every part of the project. Then I concentrated on all the surrounding of the blockchain itself: the node-wallet, the explorer-backend, all the APIs, everything that helps interacting with the blockchain itself.

#### What is it you care the most for in our creation?

I would say our team, even though it’s a small one, everyone is where they should be and we built great stuff thanks to that.

### Benoit

![](image_9634e0dbe8.jpg)

#### How should we call you and where are you located?

My name is Benoit, killerwhile, or @0xa05e30471e8a on Discord. I’m mostly based in Switzerland.

#### What/where did you study? What are your past notable experiences?

I graduated from EPFL, Lausanne where I learnt software engineering, But what I love overall in computer science is infrastructure and plumbing. I was DevOps before the word DevOps became trendy.

#### Do you have funny, sporty, geeky or cranky hobbies?

I’ve been snowboarding for more than 20 years, teaching trampoline to my kids, and playing volleyball when I want to socialize.

#### Got links?

- [https://www.linkedin.com/in/benoitperroud/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benoitperroud/)

My socials are probably not interesting enough to be shared.

#### How/when did you come across crypto?

I learned about crypto back in 2010, and followed this trend from a technical perspective, running an ETH full node and nowadays ETH 2.0 validators and Alephium full nodes.

> Simplicity and elegance of blockflow \[attracted me\] because I come from a distributed processing world, and I found in blockflow lots of echo from other components I admire and have contributed to in the past.

#### How did you come across Alephium and what attracted you to the project?

I know a guy who knew Cheng, and got introduced. Both the early stage and the simplicity of blockflow hooked me up with Alephium. Early stage because the whole ecosystem still needs to be built, and I love building things. Simplicity and elegance of blockflow because I come from a distributed processing world, and I found in blockflow lots of echo from other components I admire and have contributed to in the past.

#### What are you doing at Alephium? What is your title (if you have one, what would it be, if you don’t)? What are you good at?

At Alephium, I’m mostly in charge of the infrastructure, i.e. running a significant amount of full nodes to ensure the stability of the network. I don’t care much about titles, and Alephium’s infrastructure reliability speaks on my behalf.

But if I was forced to choose a title, I’d call myself Plumbing engineer. Or CFO, for Chief Fondue Officer. Because apart from building infrastructure, I’m amazingly proficient with cheese, being Fondue or Raclette.

#### What is it you care the most for in our creation?

Blockflow technology is so simple that many other projects are asking themselves why they didn’t think about it already. And bringing stability and resiliency to this awesome technology is what I care the most about this creation.

### Frontend Team

### Mika — UX/UI

![](image_11d3f144d4.jpeg)

#### How should we call you and where are you located?

You can call me Mika. Located in Lausanne.

#### What/where did you study?

Born and raised in France, just next to Geneva, I was quick to realise that we should all do something to try and save our planet. So I went on and studied environmental sciences in EPFL, Lausanne. I got my engineer’s degree, then directly joined a startup called Bestmile, to build a platform to manage fleet of autonomous electric vehicles. Yep, I love being a multidisciplinary person. In 2016, I entered the realm of crypto at Lykke, motivated by the idea of using this tech to break the old finance and make it more open, sustainable and fair. Alephium is a natural next step in this journey.

#### Do you have funny, sporty, geeky or cranky hobbies?

Yes! A bit of everything really. Running, biking, geeking, designing and drawing thing, creating stuff, enjoying life and nature. Try to live for a purpose that is bigger than my little self.

#### Got links?

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/mika%C3%ABl-vaivre-05526337](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mika%C3%ABl-vaivre-05526337)

#### How/when did you come across crypto?

Around 2015–2016 I believe? I discovered a crypto called Solarcoin, built to encourage the global energy transition by incentivising solar production. I bought some on Lykke — then went on and work for the exchange as a Head of Product ;)

> _Turned out that working as a team was effortless, as we managed to build awesome things quickly. So here I am today, continuing to grow with the project and looking forward to contribute to the great things to come!_

#### How did you come across Alephium and what attracted you to the project?

I knew Cheng when we were both working at Bestmile. He came to me at the very beginning of the project, asking me if I could craft Alephium’s visual identity and produce some communication and fundraising materials. I was happy to accept :) Turned out that working as a team was effortless, as we managed to build awesome things quickly. So here I am today, continuing to grow with the project and looking forward to contribute to the great things to come!

#### What are you doing at Alephium?

I’m the front-end product guy! (chief of product, for those who care about titles)

#### What is it you care the most for in our creation?

Efficiency, robustness and accessibility.

### Ilias— UX/UI

![](image_a4cb064ac9.jpeg)

#### How should we call you and where are you located?

Call me Ilias. You can find me in Zurich, Switzerland, or online under the aliases nop33/eyettea or my DJ alias, Fetamin!

#### What/where did you study ? What are your past notable experiences?

My innocent 18-year-old self decided to study Computer Science at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. It turned out to be a good move. My journey led me to CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, where I had the privilege to work amongst the world’s most renowned physicists and scientists.

#### Do you have funny, sporty, geeky or cranky hobbies?

I love messing around with knobs. Particularly, knobs that control some sort of sound output. I spend endless hours sorting and categorizing my music on my laptop so that I can grab any given opportunity to perform a DJ set with confidence! Besides my love for electronic music lately, I’ve started a geeky journey on nutrition and exercise. I’m eating the same freaking salad bowl for lunch every day, something that drives my flatmates crazy. Also, in case that was not clear already, I live on feta. Sometimes, I code apps to solve my problems.

#### How/when did you come across crypto?

I don’t remember the exact year, but I first heard of Bitcoin while I was still studying (if only I’d have been smart enough to mine some back then…) so that must have been somewhere between 2009–2013. I think it was around 2011. Then around 2013, I remember that there was an online scientific project that if you’d donate your CPU they would reward you with XRP. I donated some CPU for a few months and got some coins worth in total something like \$30. Then, I proceeded to completely forget about them for about 4 years. 2017 and a good friend of mine gets hired in a crypto company which reminded me of some coins somewhere in my subconsciousness. After an evening of scrapping old email backups, I found them, traded them for BTC and ETH, and that’s how it basically started :) I, later on, got hired by the same crypto company.

#### How did you come across Alephium and what attracted you to the project?

Networking! A colleague and good friend from my previous crypto-related job told me about Alephium in the spring of 2021, I joined the Telegram group, Cheng asked me if I am a developer, and the rest is history. At first, I worked as a freelancer during the summer of 2021, building a brand new website for the project. During those months I fell in love with the collaboration with the rest of the team and I think they liked me too because they offered me a more permanent position at Alephium. Contributing to building an open, censorship-resistant, border-less blockchain with awesome people sounded much more fun than maintaining servers did. So I quit my job and joined this amazing team.

#### What are you doing at Alephium? What is your title (if you have one, what would it be, if you don’t)? What are you good at?

I am a frontend engineer and my responsibility is to create beautiful, performant, and secure user interfaces and developer kits that allow users and developers to interact with the Alephium blockchain. I am good at listening to the things that are not being said, transforming designs into pixel-perfect UIs, and choosing the right emoji reactions. My colleagues have attributed to me the title of CMO (Chief Markdown Officer) because I showed them how to use footnotes in markdown.

> _I want to dedicate my technical and human skills towards improving the experience people have when interacting with blockchains so that their true benefits can shine._

#### What is it you care the most for in our creation?

I believe that blockchain technology has a lot to offer and that it’s here to stay. Apart from the technological challenges that some of the smartest people in the space are currently keeping themselves busy with, one of the clunkiest things at the moment is user experience. I want to dedicate my technical and human skills towards improving the experience people have when interacting with blockchains so that their true benefits can shine. Part of Alephium’s mission is to make this technology more accessible and usable than it is today. A for Adoption. A for Alephium. 🚀

### Operations and Marketing

### Maud-OPS

![](image_2a739dc68e.jpg)

#### How should we call you and where are you located?

My name is Maud, and I’m based in Zürich, Switzerland.

#### What/where did you study?

I studied Chemical Engineering at EPFL and Economics at the University of Lausanne. After that, I started working for one of Switzerland most successful start-ups called Bestmile where I met many of my current Alephium teammates! Before Alephium, I was working at Lykke, a Swiss crypto exchange.

#### Do you have funny, sporty, geeky or cranky hobbies?

Not many people know this but I used to do ski competitions when I was younger, until I broke my knee.

#### Got links?

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/maud-simon-01073394/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maud-simon-01073394/)

#### How/when did you come across crypto?

I first dived into crypto in December 2017 when I was hired at Lykke. I started helping around in the community in order to familiarize myself with the blockchain world before my official start date. December 2017 was a crazy time for crypto and it ended up being a really valuable crash course!

#### How did you come across Alephium and what attracted you to the project?

I worked with many of my Alephium teammates in my first job at Bestmile. When I left Lykke, I knew I wanted to stay in the blockchain space and I reached out to the team to see what Alephium was up to. The stars aligned, Alephium was in need of someone with my experience and I joined in June 2021.

With Alephium, I was looking forward to diving into a more technical and core side of the blockchain space. I was also excited to work again with incredibly talented people.

I’m really bullish about Alephium. Combining all our innovations, we’re offering a very much-needed, new DeFi paradigm.

#### What are you doing at Alephium?

I’m currently Chief of Staff. What it concretely means at Alephium is that I oversee everything non-development-related. I personally focus on the operational and admin sides and work with a (fantastic) team on Marketing & Comm. Fortunately, I’m really good at multitasking ;)

> _Blockchain will transform our society in many ways. I want to actively contribute to this change._

#### What is it you care the most for in our creation?

Blockchain will transform our society in many ways. I want to actively contribute to this change. Specifically, beyond the technological innovations, I am passionate about how the blockchain space has already challenged the way individuals traditionally work together. Blockchain bring together diverse and complementary talents, distributed around the world, working asynchronously towards a common goal.

As every great journey mine started over a beer with a friend in 2016 where he first told me about blockchain and crypto. Some beers and days later I was invested and since 2017 I’m working in the space.

#### How did you come across Alephium and what attracted you to the project?

I participated in the pre-sale and followed the project since then. Maud introduced me at a later stage to the team when there was a need for a finance person.

#### What are you doing at Alephium?

As CFO I’m responsible for all finance related topics at Alephium.

> _I’d say overall the most important point for me is to see Alephium achieve its goals and create a healthy ecosystem._

> _When I saw a bunch of misfits and engineers trying to solve their philosophical issues by building a decentralized decision mechanism (bitcoin), I knew I had to dive deep into that experiment._

#### How/when did you come across crypto?

I’ve been preoccupied about the way we take political decisions together in democracies for a while. When I saw a bunch of misfits and engineers trying to solve their philosophical issues by building a decentralized decision mechanism (bitcoin), I knew I had to dive deep into that experiment. There I met an incredible community, fascinating thinkers, tinkerers and builders and found a purpose in contributing to the future of our consensus-building machinery.

#### How did you come across Alephium and what attracted you to the project?

A dear friend introduced me to Alephium and its people during long and talkative walks around the Leman lake, and boozy bitcoin meet-ups in the alps. I loved the technical vision and the strong team built around it!

#### What are you doing at Alephium? What is your title (if you have one, what would it be, if you don’t)? What are you good at?

I’m helping to shape the communications and marketing of Alephium. The goal is to allow devs and amateurs to discover and understand our tech and its potential whether it’s via simple memes or complicated tech explainers, IRL or online.

#### What is it you care the most for in our creation?

I like the unbending tech ambition to bring the absolute best of crypto in all aspects and I like the proximity of the team to the community.

### Polto

![](image_78a670bcec.jpg)

#### How should we call you and where are you located?

I am known as Polto, I am located in between Geneva and Neuchâtel, Switzerland.

#### What/where did you study?

I went to school and college between Moscow and Geneva, started EPFL in Lausanne, but quickly abandoned my bachelor in computer science because I was not that good in math and was already trying myself in Free Software related business. More recently (2017–2018) I attended the MSc in Blockchain and Digital Currency from the university of Nicosia. Since 1999 I have worked on many Free Software and Open Hardware projects, mainly on image and 3D processing.

#### Do you have funny, sporty, geeky or cranky hobbies?

I am a very happy person, my hobbies are my job. I try hard to align what I do for living with my personal interests. Beside work, I like to learn about tech. I do a lot of more general (not work related) geeking & hacking. I also practice traditional karate-do and hold a 4th Dan degree.

#### Got links?

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/polto/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/polto/)

#### How/when did you come across crypto?

I heard very early about Bitcoin because I was interested in applied cryptography, but I totally dismissed it. I was “forced” to test it by a friend, but I really did not like it. User experience was bad and being a Free Software guy I got scared by the idea of “digital scarcity”. In July 2012 we wanted to accept payments in bitcoin during the RMLL conference in Geneva, but the alternative implementation in Ruby from my friend did not work and it did not happen. I forgot about Bitcoin for 2 more years. I got back via Ethereum in 2014, first by following the development. I was very enthusiastic about the generic smart contracting platform, about the “code is law” lie and the move to PoS. I started to get into “crypto” and to learn more about it. I followed the Ethereum development very closely, The DAO debacle and the fork that followed. Later as I was learning more about the ecosystem I became more and more a Bitcoin maximalist. In 2017 I started the MSc in Bitcoin and digital currencies from the university of Nicosia and worked at Bity (the first Swiss licensed crypto broker). Later I created my own company to provide self-custodial solutions for Bitcoin — Hodling SA.

> _I asked Cheng if it was “yet another shitcoin” with a lot of buzzwords or if they really intend to innovate in all of those areas… His answer was amazing_

#### How did you come across Alephium and what attracted you to the project?

I met Cheng back in 2019 at some random crypto conference. Almost everything there was miss-use of “blockchain tech”. I stopped at Alephium’s booth and started by reading all the buzzwords — 10K TPS, Sharding, UTXO model, energy efficiency… I asked Cheng if it was “yet another shitcoin” with a lot of buzzwords or if they really intend to innovate in all of those areas. His answer was amazing, first we were very aligned on the bullshit part of most buzzwords, but more surprising was his technical take on those topics, on the different tradeoffs. What he described was looking as an elegant, efficient and “easy” to implement solution. But to be really honest I did not understand much. I was working at Bity back then and told Cheng that as soon as Alephium was ready, Bity will be able to help with some aspects of the private pre-sale. We stayed in touch and met many times over the next two years to exchange on different topics. I made some introductions, got more confidence in the tech, and seeing the traction by March 2021 I “officially” joined as advisor to help with the private pre-sale and the related regulatory aspects. After the mainnet launch we intensified our collaboration. I am now working for the Alephium project ~1 day per week.

#### What are you doing at Alephium?

I am mostly connecting people, helping to find the best partners, working on the strategy, legal & regtech aspects. If I should have a title it would be NBO — No Bullshit Officer

#### What is it you care the most for in our creation?

No bullshit!

In 2015 I was working in the IT department of a company, and a colleague sent me the Bitcoin white paper. From that moment on, I got hooked.

#### How did you come across Alephium, and what attracted you to the project?

I saw a job posting about content creation (something that I love to do). I started to get deeper into the tech. The idea of combining the UTXO model and smart contracts is one that I found intriguing, and the explanation for it was amazing. I’m thrilled to be here to see that happening live.

#### What are you doing at Alephium? What is your title (if you have one, what would it be, if you don’t)? What are you good at?

I’m helping to raise awareness by writing content for our blog, Twitter account, and other social media outlets. So let’s spread the word!

#### What is it you care the most for with Alephium?

It has awesome tech, and the core team goes the extra mile to make the interaction with it (wallet, explorer, etc.) easy to understand (and looks beautiful as well). Alephium is in that sweet spot, ready to deliver a great product, and I want to help the community fully comprehend it.
