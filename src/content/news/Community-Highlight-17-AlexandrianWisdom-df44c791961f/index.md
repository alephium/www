#### **What can we call you, and where should we picture you?**

My name is Steven, AKA <a href="https://twitter.com/Alexandrian777" data-href="https://twitter.com/Alexandrian777">AlexandrianWisdom</a>. I live in Atlanta, Georgia and you’re likely to find me in a local coffee shop watching crypto charts or reading.

#### **Tell us a bit about yourself, what you’re doing, what you’re passionate about in life, your Hobbies?**

Besides mining and investing in crypto, I’m very passionate about studying ancient languages and translating religious and philosophical texts in my spare time. I’m fond of Greek, Latin, and Syriac.

#### **Can you share with us how you first discovered Alephium, what caught your attention about it, and what keeps you in the community?**

To be honest, the very first thing that sparked my interest in researching more about Alephium was the fact that it has the Hebrew letter “Aleph” in its name- after learning more about the project I fell in love with both it and the community around it.

#### **What aspects or features of Alephium are the most exciting or innovative? What sets it apart from other projects?**

I find Alephium’s ability to combine the best of both UTXO and account-based models into a secure and scalable blockchain a work of beauty inside and out, both in the technology and even in the UI itself. More than anything, the team and community set Alephium apart from all other projects.

#### **Which projects or dApps built on Alephium & part of that ecosystem are you most intrigued/excited about?**

Currently, I’m most intrigued by DeFi on Alephium, specifically RootFinance. I think it would be really cool to have a dApp that allows users to take out loans and earn interest on Alephium.

#### **What’s your view on the ecosystem growth and evolution of the past few months? What are you looking forward to the most in Alephium?**

The ecosystem has simply exploded with new members, developers, and even sponsors. It’s really cool to see how far it has come since March of last year when I first discovered Alephium.

What I’m looking forward to most would be the ability to mine on Alephium with ASICs! (I see you, Bitmain!) I think this will bring even greater security to the blockchain.

#### **Anything else you’d like to add?**

Oh yes- I am the proud owner of the highest Zealy score on Alephium! I’m convinced this will come in handy one day; until then, it is my badge of honour! :)
