Full Node v2.0.0 released; All nodes need to update before activation

After over one year of building and testing the new features, Alephium is excited to announce that the Leman Network Upgrade is scheduled for **10:00 AM GMT on March 30th, 2023**. With the enhanced dev tools offering, the blockchain will be better prepared to support a growing ecosystem building on top of Alephium.

## Actions to be¬†taken

### Full Nodes

With the release of the latest Full Node v2.0.0, everything is set to activate the Leman Network Upgrade, and network participants need to check if they have everything ready.

**After the activation timestamp, full nodes with a version under v2.0.0 will not sync with the network.**

### **Full Node run¬†locally**

Users running a full node locally must update their software to v2.0.0. If also running an explorer backend, it is mandatory to upgrade to the latest version

### **Miners**

Users running a full node locally must update their software to v2.0.0.

### **External Full¬†Node**

[Dappnode](https://dappnode.com/): There is nothing to do for users using Dappnode with auto-update options checked. If not, the user must go to the Alephium package and click the upgrade/update button.

[Flux](https://runonflux.io/): No action is required from users using Flux.

### **Services providers**

The latest Full Node v2.0.0 and Explorer Backend 1.13.1 (if necessary) must be installed for service providers such as exchanges and wallet providers. The ones running dockers must use the latest docker image with the matched version of the full node and explorer backend.

Download the latest version of the Full Node (v2.0.0) here:

## Leman Network Upgrade Enhancements

### **Security**

The [Leman Network Upgrade](/news/post/announcing-the-leman-network-upgrade-c01a81e65f0e) includes new features at the language (Ralph) and [Virtual Machine](/news/post/meet-alphred-a-virtual-machine-like-no-others-85ce86540025) (Alphred) level, which will aid developers in creating complex dApps more easily.

### **Bridge**

The Leman Upgrade clears the way for Alephium Bridge deployment, connecting Alephium and other blockchains. It will enable seamless interaction and interoperability between our ecosystem and other blockchains, starting with Ethereum.

### **Developer Experience &¬†SDK**

The Leman Upgrade has new Virtual Machine instructions and built-in functions. The ‚ÄúSub-contract‚Äù concept and new built-in functions for debugging, asserting, logging, migrating existing contracts, burning tokens, etc., to improve the dApp development experience.

New Node/Explorer APIs, web3 library, and wallets (through WalletConnect & [browser extension](/news/post/alephium-launches-browser-extension-wallet-706dfeda98f5)) will help reduce the required software development cycle to build dApps on Alephium.
