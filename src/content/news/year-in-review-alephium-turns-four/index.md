On Saturday, 8th November, Alephium reached four years “on-chain”. 

To mark the occasion, take a look at twelve articles from the past 12 months that demonstrate our commitment to building, delivering, forging exciting partnerships, and continuing to innovate in the decentralized world.

## 1. Alephium <> BNB Chain (BSC)

For a non-EVM chain such as Alephium, building bridges to other active networks is incredibly important. It has been almost one year since the BSC bridge went live.

## 3. Alephium x CryptoXR Hackathon

Alephium hosted an exceptional hackathon in Auxerre at CryptoXR, pushing forward the future of Web3. Cheng and Hongchao were joined by Nicolas Bacca of Ledger on the judges' panel.

## 4. Alephium x Hacken

Security is everything, and while Alephium is secure by design and engineering, it doesn't hurt to beef up security by having the right partnerships in place.

## 5. Alephium x DIA <> Oracles

Verifiable Random Function (VRF) Oracles arrived on Alephium thanks to an exciting integration with DIA. This seemingly simple feature is a game changer for a number of our dApps.

## 8. Alephium + Danube Upgrade

Danube was the biggest upgrade Alephium has ever done, and marked one of the most important moments of the past 12 months.

## 9. [](https://alephium.org/news/post/danube-upgrade-everything-you-need-to-know-faq/)Alephium x PrimeVault

Institutional access to DeFi has been one of the biggest trends of the last year, and is something we intentionally addressed through a partnership with PrimeVault.

## 10. Alephium + Phase 2: Aligned Economics

After delivering Danube, we planned and announced the next major update. With a Core dApp (CLMM DEX) and $ALPH staking on the way, there's good reason to be excited about the future of coin utility on Alephium.
