The **crypto industry** moves in waves, often riding tempestuous storms. Now, the winds are changing, the seas are calming, and something has been spotted out **on the horizon**. 

*What is it?* Well, it appears to be the start of “**L1 Season**”. It’s too hard to say yet for sure, but as we peer through the Alephium telescope, the signs are all there. Fly the sails!

**Google**, **Stripe**, **Circle**, **Tether**, and **Bitfinex** have all set about **building** **[new L1 blockchains](https://thedefiant.io/news/research-and-opinion/crypto-web3-experts-question-corp-chains-like-tempo)**. As a result, we can start ‌collectively validating the importance of the base layer. L2 season may well be over. Yet, this raises an important question. *Do we really need more L1s?*

An even more important question… *Do we really need more L1s that are centralized, built on a Web2 foundation, and are backed by corporate giants?*

We’ll leave the answer up to you. First things first, **read this article**. 

*P.S. If you’re new to Alephium, we are a PoW Layer-1 blockchain and have [recently announced](https://x.com/alephium/status/1958886335202435548) that we are entering “Phase 2: Aligned Economics”. This will see our devs build a Core dApp as a strategic addition to our chain.*

## The Rise of Corporate-Backed Chains

With enough money, talent, influence, and time, you can solve almost any problem for users. That’s why it’s pretty much inevitable that **Google**, **Stripe**, **Circle**, **Tether**, and **Bitfinex** will succeed with their L1s. Success, though, has different forms and different definitions. 

For those who believe in the **core ethos of Web3** and **Bitcoin-like fundamentals**, these platforms may not be aligned.

The market demands **credible neutrality**, censorship resistance, and no single point of failure. Can corporate-backed L1s guarantee these attributes, or will they recycle old compromises with **convenience-layer blockchains**? Only time will tell. 

This is exactly why Alephium [continues to stand](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/68c307ab679d8613e86156e2/) as a principled and open alternative, one that was built for the long haul. **Scalability without surrender**. 

## The Principled Path: Why We Built From Scratch

*Do we really need more L1s?* Perhaps the question needs tweaking. ***What kind of L1s do we need?*** As others have taken the easier path of copying existing codebases or building with EVM compatibility, Alephium made the strategic decision to **build a new class of blockchain** from scratch. We are playing the long game. 

The non-EVM route was a **deliberate engineering decision** to avoid and **overcome the compromises** found on other chains. Rather than re-skin or fork an existing solution, we meticulously designed one for security, sustainability, and longevity.

While these decisions may have made our route to success longer than EVM-compatible chains, our trilemma-solving tech offers more integrity.

With this approach, we ensured that Alephium would be **resilient by design** and **built for decades and generations,** not market cycles. We aren’t thinking about the next bull run. We are thinking about **the next century**. 

This Satoshi-like ideology is why we can offer the decentralization of Bitcoin with the smart contract flexibility of Ethereum, all without the trade-offs others have willingly accepted. **All native, no asterisks**. 

While that may not have translated into an enormous TVL (yet), we believe that our ongoing improvements, upgrades, and especially the **unique economic design of our protocol-owned Core dApp** will eventually attract it. 

## From Foundations to Functions: Phase 1 & 2

*Let’s reflect for a moment.* 

It was said **Proof-of-Work** couldn’t scale without compromises, both mathematical and hardware. Cheng said, “*Hold my hat*”. He built it. Just remember that before L1 Season begins and we become trendy again.

**Our Phase 1** focused on the base layer, delivering a **production-ready foundation**. These past years were more than just R&D, they were proof that **PoW scales**, native sharding works, and sUTXO can **prevent exploits at the VM level**. 

We've shown that true decentralization, high performance, and usability **don't actually have to be mutually exclusive**, as critics previously thought.

**Phase 2** is where our infrastructure [evolves and aligns](/news/post/from-scalable-infrastructure-to-aligned-economics). We’re programming a **self-sustaining ecosystem** for the community and $ALPH holders. This is our “why”, our **North Star**. As in the past, we are **building for long-term endurance**, not trends that are gone in a flash.

We’re launching our own Core dApp as a **native growth engine** and **definitive proof-of-concept**. Once launched, we’ll enter a new economic model where infrastructure, economics, and governance are properly **aligned**.

In this new system, there will also be more **involvement from DAOs**. Alephium DAOs will put marketing and development resources where they belong: in community hands. No boardroom votes, no Cap Table politics. Just raw, directed **momentum toward adoption**. That’s how truly decentralized networks **scale their influence**. 

## Your Coin, Working for You

Whether L1 season arrives or not, $ALPH holders will be ushered into an exciting **new utility model**. The Core dApp will be both **protocol-owned** and **open-source**, with all swap fees being **redistributed to xALPH stakers** and used for **$ALPH buybacks**.

It’s critical for onlookers, builders, and community members to understand the "**Aligned Ecosystem Loop**”. Let’s revisit it:

1. dApp usage generates fees.
2. Fees are used to buy back and burn $ALPH, initiating deflationary forces and rewards for long-term ALPH stakers.
3. Stakers align incentives around governance and adoption, which further decentralizes growth and restarts the cycle.

**Outcome:** Your $ALPH is no longer a passive asset but a productive one that gets stronger with every transaction.

## A Future Built With You, For You

Our **long-term vision** is not about us; it’s about you: the community, the builders, and the ALPH holders.

The **rise of corporate-backed L1s** shows us the **risks of consolidated power**. Let them chase quick wins. Alephium stands apart because **we are building for infinity**. Right now, however, we are **empowering the community** and ecosystem to drive the network's growth and decision-making.

Community-driven initiatives like the BlockFlow Alliance DAO, are a key part of **our second phase**. These initiatives empower the community to allocate resources toward marketing, developer support, and onboarding. 

Build here, and you're betting on:

* Lasting tech, built for generations
* Realigned economics (holders > speculators)
* The next chapter of PoW

This is a clear **path toward decentralized governance** and decision-making, ensuring that the network’s future is determined by its participants, **not a centralized entity** (or a boardroom). 

When you hold and stake $ALPH, you become a welcome participant in a cycle that makes the coin **stronger with every transaction**. This is a **true vote of confidence** in a project that prioritizes **endurance** and a long-term approach to a decentralized future.

The next decade belongs to teams who ignore short-term trends and build long-term foundations. 

**Welcome aboard**. You’re early.

## A Principled Alternative

*While new corporate L1s focus on consolidating enterprises and PoS chains struggle with centralization risks, Alephium is offering an open alternative. We are a PoW chain that scales and sustains, resilient by design, aligned by principle, and built to last.* 

*If L1 Season does arrive on our timelines, let it not be about who raises the most capital. Let the narrative be about credibility, security, and delivering decentralized foundations for the future. Framed that way, Alephium may already be leagues ahead.*

*Our **next article** will take an even deeper look at the rise of Centralized L1s, helping people to better understand why they might be a concern for Web3 and the principles of decentralization.*
