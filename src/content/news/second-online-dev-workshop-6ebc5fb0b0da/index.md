Following the success of our [first dev workshop](/news/post/first-developer-workshop-build-a-token-faucet-a6bb2aa7bf68) in July, we are having the next one! We will be re-implementing the [friend.tech](http://friend.tech) smart contract in RALPH.

## What is friend.tech

The core concept of friend.tech is to create a network of friends where users can buy and sell shares (called keys) to access gated content. Once set up, users may have “keys” to their chatroom bought by other users or bots, allowing direct communication with keys holders. Buying a user’s keys enables communication and adds a new asset to the buyer’s portfolio.

## Workshop Agenda

This time it will require two sessions, one about sub-contracts, and the other one about the [APS (Asset Permission System)](/news/post/alephiums-aps-eliminating-evm-token-approval-risks-5407e7e70a33).

**For the first session:**
