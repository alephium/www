The Blockflow Alliance, the first ever DAO for community development on Alephium, has recently been [created](https://discord.com/channels/747741246667227157/1156214551939919962/1158432340951961733). Its main contributors and founders have applied for a grant from the Ecosystem Funds through the [grants &amp; rewards program](https://github.com/alephium/community/blob/master/Grant%26RewardProgram.md).

Alephium is very happy to announce that **the grant request has been approved**, the Blockflow Alliance will receive 20’000 \$ALPH to kickstart its first month of operations. The grant will be renewed monthly as long as the funds are effectively used and spent in accordance with the objectives initially defined.

The Alephium core-contributors are very excited to have such an energetic and creative group of community members willing to spend time and energy contributing to the growth of the Alephium world!
