### The results of Alephium’s naming competition are in!

#### The team has spoken & the favorite name suggestions are 🥁

### Team’s Favorites

#### Smallest Denomination

**Set *(digdug#5494) — 40 ALPH (40 \* 10¹⁸ Sets)  
***Relating to the math behind Aleph, namely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Set Theory.</a> Easy on the tongue. Phonetically close to both “Cent” and “Sat’”. The fact that one of the team members’ first name is Set has nothing to do with it!

#### Virtual Machine

**Alphred *(eyettea#6915) — 0 ALPH  
***Eyettea is a team member and we are not entitled to rewards. More ALPH for the others! \o/ However, the name Alphred immediately stuck! It was an obvious match for everyone. And Batman’s butler, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mr. Pennyworth</a> would agree! 🦇

#### Smart Contract Language

**Ralph *(psua#1101) — 40 ALPH  
***The initial suggestion was Rust-Alph, but now that we had Alphred in the house, this made a lot more sense than its literal transcription. Thus there was Ralph! A language to build the dApps of them all! 🦾

We were frankly impressed with the quality of the suggestions. Even the unexpected ones are quirky, witty or plain interesting.

We picked additional winners in two more categories: *Funniest* and *Naming competition gone wrong.*

**We’d also like to reward two honorable mentions: Chengli** (zocker#6039) and **Wernick** (greentin#0379) who will get **5 ALPH** each. *Wernick* sent the older of us back to our childhood. It is the currency of Alf’s home planet, a TV-show from the 80s. *Chengli* touched the hearts of the Swiss team-members.

**The awarded participants will be contacted by the team during the next round of community reward distribution which will take place by the end of February.**

We’re impressed and humbled by the creativity, imagination and engagement of our community! According to you, if we were a cartoon character we’d be Betty Boop. If we were a Greek god, we’d be running on OLYMPUS. If we’d be a particle, we’d be a PLANCK, and if we’d be spiritual we’d be ELOHIMIUM.
