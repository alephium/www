After reaching the deadline for submission on the 15th of April, we had received a whopping fifteen (15) contributions from the video creators in our community. All of whom blessed us with their interpretation of how to best leverage motion design to explain what Alephium is, in a wide range of styles and expressions.

Reviewing the videos was a great deal of fun, but the choice wasn’t easy! However, the jury agreed on three (3) favorites.

- <span id="0362"><a href="https://youtu.be/TYNwlDo4B-M" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" data-href="https://youtu.be/TYNwlDo4B-M" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Samuel</strong></a>**  
  **Great pace, slick animations and neat synthetic voice-over. The overall consistency stood out.</span>
- <span id="9e7f"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtaQE9ADUnU" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtaQE9ADUnU" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Zephir</strong></a>**  
  **Visible work on the custom illustrations and a great demonstration of research. The script was more than just a transcript of the example article that was provided.</span>
- <span id="1e48"><a href="https://youtu.be/_2S_BAHf3b8" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" data-href="https://youtu.be/_2S_BAHf3b8" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Zionafari</strong></a>**  
  **This video introduced us to one of Doctor Ralph’s avatar. He rocks! The animated character struck the jury as a creative approach for the narration.</span>

All the other creators will be rewarded for their greatly appreciated efforts.

**All participants will be contacted by email on the address they submitted within ten (10) days, so watch that inbox to claim your reward!**
